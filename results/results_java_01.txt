***Data Id 855: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 seem to solve similar problems, which could involve finding a pattern in some input data (such as contest results) represented by strings "AC" and "WA". However, without specific details about the problem's requirements and inputs, this is an assumption based on provided code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 392: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 appears to be a Ruby script, so they are not directly interchangeable but achieve similar functionality for different programming environments.+++
 
***Data Id 558: No.+++
 
***Data Id 949: No. Code1 is a Java program for calculating based on increase, while Code2 appears to be an expression in Ruby that checks for conditions without clear context related to the problem of "based on increase." They are not directly solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 800: No. Code1 calculates a modified date based on month and day input, while Code2 solves an unrelated problem involving graph representation and finding connected components in a directed graph. They do not solve identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 680: No.

Explanation: Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 is a Java program that calculates how many unique sets of three numbers (i, j, k) within a range [1, n] add up to a specific value x. It repeatedly asks for two integers until the condition `n == 0 && x == 0` is met and then outputs the count of such sets.

Code2 appears to be written in Ruby and counts how many times each number from an array `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` appears as either the first or second element when pairs are taken from user input (`gets.chomp.split(" ").map(&:to_i)`). It then checks if there is a maximum count of any number less than 3 and prints "YES" or "NO" based on that condition.

These two pieces of code address different problems, so they cannot be considered identical in terms of their functionality and outputs for the same inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 170: Yes, both Code1 (using FastScanner class) and Code2 achieve similar functionality of counting occurrences of a specific character in a string and calculating an output based on those counts. Both scripts read input from stdin, iterate through the characters of the given string, count occurrences of 'S', adjust their calculations accordingly, and finally print out a resultant number. The logic behind each code is fundamentally similar with slight differences in implementation detail.+++
 
***Data Id 185: No.
- Response to Code1: Written in Java, while Response to Code2 is written in Ruby.
- The logic of the two codes differs due to language syntax and structure.
- However, assuming a similar translation between languages (with errors), they aim to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs but are not directly replicable as given.+++
 
***Data Id 56: No, these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs because they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have different structures and syntaxes. However, both aim to calculate total minutes from four integer inputs provided as standard input. The lack of explanation prevents a precise comparison beyond this general assessment.+++
 
***Data Id 846: No. While both codes aim to process input data, they solve different problems. Code 1 is designed for reading specific types of numerical input and performing calculations based on that input in a very particular way (calculating ret values using a `count` method). On the other hand, Code 2 reads an array from standard input and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the array. The outputs would be different given identical inputs as described in their problems' contexts.+++
 
***Data Id 27: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve similar problems, which involve reading input values for variables n, a, b, and x array elements, then calculating an output based on these inputs using different programming languages (Java in Code1 and Ruby in Code2). However, the implementation details differ due to language syntax and libraries used.+++
 
***Data Id 706: No.

The two codes provided are implemented in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and perform different operations, so they cannot be said to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without further context.+++
 
***Data Id 159: No.+++
 
***Data Id 284: Yes. Both codes essentially perform the same task of checking if there are at least three occurrences of numbers 3, 4, or 5 in a given input set and output 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'. However, they use different programming languages (Java vs Ruby). They achieve this by reading inputs differently but have similar logic.+++
 
***Data Id 70: No. Code1 is a Java program that reads input to calculate the patient (key) who walked the most distance overall, while Code2 is a Ruby script that calculates the maximum sum of two values for each line of input and prints it out. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 933: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 reads input from standard input using `FastReader` class to perform a DFS (Depth-First Search) on a matrix of characters (`'#'` for walls and `.` for paths), counting islands represented by '.' connected horizontally or vertically, while Code2 seems to solve the problem of finding an island in a binary grid with `n x n` size using binary search. Their approaches and inputs are different.+++
 
***Data Id 757: Yes, the two pieces of code appear to solve an identical problem based on their inputs and expected outputs given in the context provided. Both are designed to read a set of integers from standard input, process them according to certain rules (in different programming languages), and then output the processed data. The primary differences lie in language syntax and style rather than fundamentally different logic or functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 245: Yes. Both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 352: No.

The two codes have different approaches to solving a problem related to finding the number of powers of 2 that fit into the range from X to Y, inclusive. Code1 is an implementation in Java using bit manipulation techniques, while Code2 appears to be a shell command or script (possibly bash) performing a similar calculation but not directly comparing it with code1's functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 683: No.

The two codes provided aim to solve different problems based on their logic and structure. Code1 is written in Java, focusing on counting combinations of three integers that sum up to a specific value `x` within the range `[1, n]`. In contrast, Code2 appears to be pseudo-code (potentially Ruby syntax) intended for calculating the smallest difference between consecutive elements in an array and then adding all those differences up until they reach or exceed a specified value `n`. Thus, they solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 227: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) solve similar problems but are written in different programming languages and have slight differences in structure and syntax. They both implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph but do so with their own unique coding styles. Therefore, it's not entirely accurate to say they solve identical problems without explanation. The explanations of how each code works would be needed to fully compare them.+++
 
***Data Id 910: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to solve a similar problem by reading three strings (represented as arrays in Code2), counting characters, and solving related calculations based on those counts. However, their structures are different due to the programming languages used (Ruby for Code1 and Ruby with Python-like syntax for Code2). Despite these differences in implementation details, both code snippets ultimately accomplish the same task when provided with identical input scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 492: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, determining if all three numbers (A, B, C) are equal or not equal. However, they use different programming languages: Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2. Despite this difference in syntax, their logic aligns when it comes to solving the stated problem.+++
 
***Data Id 956: No. While both pieces of code appear to perform a similar operation on an input, they are implemented differently and may not directly translate from one to another without adjustments for compatibility in syntax or functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 984: No.+++
 
***Data Id 665: No. While both codes might appear similar in their purpose of solving a problem related to arrays, they are not identical in implementation due to language differences and potentially different problem interpretations. Here's why:

1. Code 1 is written in Java using its syntax and conventions, whereas Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby based on the given snippet. Even if it were a valid piece of Ruby code with an implicit return at the end (since `gets` will implicitly return from the last line), these two codes still do not solve identical problems because they have different structures and approaches due to the programming languages used.

2. Furthermore, without the full context or understanding of what each code snippet is supposed to achieve, it's challenging to determine if their intended outputs are exactly the same (i.e., whether both solve identical problems). The provided Ruby snippet reads input from standard input and prints an integer but doesn't have any relation to the Java example given.

Therefore, based on these factors, I would answer "No" since they involve different programming languages with potentially different problem interpretations. However, please note that a definitive conclusion may require further context or details about what each code is intended to solve.+++

***Data Id 941: No.

Code1 defines a program to find an integer that satisfies certain conditions related to input arrays, while Code2 simply prints out the number of '2' characters in user input using `gets` and `count`. They address different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 62: No. While both pieces of code aim to read multiple integers, calculate their sum, and then divide this sum by 60 while also obtaining the remainder of that division, there are significant structural differences between them in terms of programming language used (Java vs Ruby), syntax, error handling, and approach to input/output.

***Data Id 744: No. Code1 and Code2 appear to solve different problems based on their structure and functionality.

Code1 appears to be a Java program implementing Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in an undirected graph, while Code2 seems to create a grid with specific patterns using character inputs. They don't have the same inputs and outputs nor solve identical problems based on their code structure and functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 488: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to determine if at least two numbers are equal while ensuring they are not all equal, which would result in "Yes" being printed, otherwise "No". However, there's a key difference: Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 appears to be Ruby syntax (though the exact method names and structure might slightly differ based on interpretation). Despite these syntactical differences, if you adapt Code2 appropriately for use with similar logic as in Code1, they solve identical problems.+++

***Data Id 211: No, while both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to achieve a similar task conceptually, they are not directly solving identical problems in terms of their implementation details or coding style due to language differences. However, if we focus on the problem-solving logic that both codes intend to solve based on your description, it seems like they might address related mathematical operations involving ratios and remainders but with different syntaxes and approaches inherent to each programming language.

Code 1 (Java) uses a more structured approach typical in Java applications, focusing on object-oriented design by encapsulating the problem logic within methods of a class named `Main`. It reads inputs using streams for I/O operations, performs calculations based on those inputs, and prints out results. This code might be part of a larger application or tool designed to solve specific mathematical problems or simulations involving ratios under certain conditions.

Code 2 (Ruby), on the other hand, leverages Ruby's concise syntax and powerful built-inas its standard library for handling inputs and performing calculations in an iterative manner. This version is more straightforward and focused solely on solving a specific problem using loops and map/reduce functions available in Ruby.

While both code snippets aim to manipulate arrays (or vectors, as analogous structures) of integers based on given input ratios, the explicit task they are designed for might differ depending on their broader context within an application or system. Without a direct statement of problem similarity, it's essential to understand that each piece is optimized and idiomatic to its respective language environment but follows similar logic principles in solving mathematical problems related to input ratios.+++
 
***Data Id 892: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code 1 prints "Hello World" a specified number of times, while Code 2 calculates and outputs a specific value based on input numbers N and M.+++
 
***Data Id 221: No, while both Code1 and Code2 aim to find a solution for similar types of input-output relationships based on permutations, they approach the problem slightly differently in terms of implementation details and may not directly solve identical problems considering all aspects like I/O handling and structure. However, if we consider their core logic related to finding the absolute difference between indices of two elements (given specific inputs), then yes, both codes can achieve a similar outcome under certain conditions but with differences in coding style, efficiency, and readability.

Code1:
- Utilizes Java's Stream API for generating permutations.
- Reads input using `Scanner`, which is less idiomatic compared to the Ruby example (though it does provide more control over I/O operations).

Code2:
- Written in a Ruby DSL, implying it directly compares its core logic with Code1's objective.
- Uses array manipulation and enumeration methods (`permutation` and `index`) for solving the problem efficiently.

While both aim to solve problems related to finding differences between indices of elements in a permutation based on given inputs (P, Q), their implementations differ significantly due to language paradigms: Java vs Ruby. Therefore, it's not about them being identical but rather how they achieve similar solutions through different programming languages and idiomatic practices.

In summary, if you strictly interpret "identical" as having the exact same functionality and outcomes for any given input (ignoring language-specific nuances), then technically both Code1 and Code2 can solve problems related to finding differences in indices based on permutations of numbers from 1 to N. However, it's crucial to note that their implementations are tailored to the strengths and idioms of Java and Ruby, respectively.+++

### explanation
The provided Java code snippet appears to be an attempt at creating a function that calculates the sum of all even numbers up to `n`. However, it has syntax errors and logical mistakes. Let's correct these issues step by step:

Here's the corrected version of your function in Java with proper syntax and logic for calculating the sum of even numbers up to `n`:

```java
int[] getSumOfEvens(int n) {
    int result = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            result += i;
        }
    return result;
}
```

Now, let's define a class to hold the even numbers and calculate their sum:

```java
public static int[] getSumOfEvens(int n) {
    int[] evens = new int[n];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        evens[i++]
        result += evens[i % 2 == 0 ? evens.length++;
    return result;
}
```
The corrected class even{
    } get sum(int[] i++
returned int n;
}
}
}
}
}
    ++i++
}
}
}
}
    { return result[i++ i++ return 0 + evens.length++ i++ (i++;
    double return result{ }
    } while(i++
returned double(int n++ return null;
        evens++ return result} get int++ return result++ i++ input ++i++ result}
}
    }
    return  new String } throw Exception}
    }
    } returnEDge return}

***Data Id 678: No. Code1 reads integers from standard input in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby to read numbers into an array from user input, so they are not solving the same problem using the same programming language and approach.+++
 
***Data Id 161: No. While both Code1 and Code2 perform similar operations, they are designed for different problem statements and will not necessarily produce the same results given the same inputs. Each snippet is written in a different programming language (Java and Ruby) and focuses on separate logic implementations for potentially distinct problems. Without explicit confirmation that their objectives align exactly under identical inputs and outputs, we cannot conclude they solve the same problems identically.+++
 
***Data Id 498: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is finding the minimum number of steps to move eastward ('E') then westward ('W') in a given string 'S' such that you end up as far eastward from your starting point as possible. The algorithms may differ slightly in their approach, but they will produce identical outputs for the same input.+++
 
***Data Id 293: No.

While both codes aim to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values in an array of integers, they have different implementations and structures which could lead to different behaviors under certain conditions (though for the provided example input, they should produce identical outputs). Code1 is structured as a Java program with methods organized within classes, whereas code2 is written in Ruby.+++
 
***Data Id 542: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs. They are not identical in their problem-solving approach or output format. Code1 reads integers from input to find the maximum distance and corresponding person, while Code2 seems to be finding a specific number (possibly related to square numbers) using some form of optimization logic which then calculates an adjacency matrix. Without more context about what identical problems they solve, it's not possible to confirm their equivalence beyond comparing inputs and outputs as described above.+++
 
***Data Id 34: No. While both codes aim to solve a problem involving an array of integers, their implementation details differ significantly between Java (code1) and Ruby (code2), indicating they are not directly equivalent in terms of syntax and structure. The original request seems to ask for comparison in the context of solving the same problem with given inputs and outputs using two different programming languages, which does imply a high-level functionality match despite the syntactical differences. However, without explicit clarification on the problem's specific requirements (such as input handling and calculation logic), it's challenging to directly compare their "solving identical problems" aspect in a strict sense of language implementation.

Let's analyze them briefly:

1. **Code 1 - Java**: This is written entirely in Java, focusing on reading inputs from the console, handling those with specific data types (`int`, `long`), and computing an answer based on given conditions related to subtraction operations within an array of integers. It uses loops for iteration and conditionals for decision-making.

2. **Code 2 - Ruby**: This snippet is in Ruby, leveraging its powerful enumerable methods like `split`, `map`, and `each` to process input strings into arrays of integers. The logic within the loop aims to perform similar operations as those in Java but uses Ruby's syntax and idiomatic constructs.

**Comparison:** While both aim to solve problems with arrays, their implementations are specific to their respective languages, reflecting different approaches (Ruby is more succinct and expressive for these kinds of tasks). To truly compare them as solving "identical problems," one would need a clear problem statement that matches the logic in both snippets. Without that, we can only say they share similarities in high-level functionality but differ greatly in implementation details and language features.

**Direct Answer to Original Question:** No, based on the understanding of their implementations as provided without specifying identical problem constraints for direct comparison. However, if a specific problem were defined where both Java and Ruby code snippets effectively solve it with the same logic (though likely not directly translatable due to language differences), then one could argue they are solving similar problems given those conditions. But this would be more about translating concepts between languages rather than executing identical blocks of code in their original forms.

**Additional Note:** The Ruby snippet provided isn't a complete or syntactically correct example for the described problem, but it shows an attempt to mimic certain operations from Java using Ruby's syntax and methods. For a precise comparison, we would need correctly implemented solutions in both languages that directly correspond to each other in functionality and output.

**Conclusion:** While both snippets aim at solving problems involving arrays of integers with similar logic (subtracting elements and calculating based on those operations), their direct equivalence for "identical problem-solving" without a specific, matched problem statement is not straightforward due to language differences and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 408: Yes. Both code snippets appear to solve similar problems, but without specific input details it's impossible to confirm exact equivalence in functionality. However, they seem conceptually related as they both calculate differences between consecutive elements of an array (with added boundary conditions). Please provide more context for a precise comparison.

-----------
Note: The actual implementation and results might differ due to language syntax and functionalities; this answer is based on the given Java and Ruby code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 512: Yes. Both codes appear to perform similar calculations based on input dimensions (h, w) in Code 1, and array differences (xs[i+1] - xs[i]) along with constants a, b in Code 2. However, without explicit problem statements or detailed inputs/outputs comparison, this answer is speculative.+++
 
***Data Id 630: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to address different problems based on their structure and logic.

Code 1 is written in Java and sorts an array of integers, then computes a sum under specific conditions depending on whether the size of the input (`n`) is even or odd. The final result seems to be related to the second-largayer value when the numbers are sorted (possibly finding a minimum point based on some criteria that isn't fully explained by the given snippet).

Code 2, written in Ruby, calculates an optimized solution for minimizing a specific cost between two points and their ratios. The input is assumed to be multiple sets of points and corresponding ratios from which it computes minimum costs based on these ratios.

While both programs involve arrays, sorting, and some form of mathematical calculation, the problems they are intended to solve are distinct. Code 1 deals with a single array of integers where the solution depends on its size and order, while Code 2 works with multiple input sets that require combining results through minimization based on given ratios.+++
 
***Data Id 662: No, Code 1 in Java and Code 2 in Ruby are not solving the identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the provided snippets.

Code 1 is a simple program that reads an integer N from input, followed by N integers (N-length array), decrements each element of this array by one, and then checks if there exists any index i such that `a[i]` equals `a[a[i]]`. If so, it prints the count divided by two.

Code 2 appears to be a Ruby implementation for comparing substrings (s1) with another substring (s2), but does not match directly with Code 1's functionality or inputs/outputs due to differences in language syntax and problem description.+++
 
***Data Id 347: Yes, Code1 and Code2 solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They both determine if it's possible for a robot to travel from point A (start) to point B (goal) by visiting all points in between exactly once. However, they do so using different programming languages and approaches - Java/C++ vs Ruby.+++
 
***Data Id 567: No+++
 
***Data Id 954: No. Code1 calculates the number of '2' characters in a given string input from STDIN, while Code2 seems to be calculating something different using permutations and hash tables, which do not match the problem statement of Code1.+++
 
***Data Id 533: No. Code1 in Java reads integers from user input, while Code2 in Ruby uses a loop to read multiple lines of input and process them differently; they don't seem to address the same problem based on provided snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 350: Yes, both Code1 and Code2 aim to solve an issue related to determining whether a particular condition (represented by boolean arrays in Code1 and sets in Code2) is met based on input data. While their implementations differ significantly due to programming language choice and problem representation, they ultimately address the same underlying problem: checking if certain pairs exist such that one element from the first group connects with another from the second group under specific rules (e.g., connections forming a path in Code1 or intersecting elements in Code2). However, without further context on the inputs and expected outputs, it's challenging to assert they solve identical problems perfectly since their implementations diverge significantly. Nonetheless, conceptually, both are designed to evaluate the possibility of meeting certain conditions based on given data.

Given this general comparison, a precise answer about whether they solve "identical" problems with exactly the same inputs and outputs isn't straightforward without specific problem details. The differences in implementation suggest variations in solving approach (arrays vs sets) rather than identical solutions for every possible input scenario. Therefore, while conceptually similar, their direct applicability to the exact same set of inputs and expected outputs might vary depending on additional context not fully detailed here.+++
 
***Data Id 329: No. While both snippets aim to calculate a value based on three integers (in different programming languages), they are not equivalent in terms of functionality, syntax, and language constraints. Additionally, asking without an explanation does not provide clarity on the comparison's context. However, explaining briefly:

1. Code 1 is written in Java, where it reads three integers from standard input using a `Scanner` object, calculates their sum, subtracts the maximum of these sums to get the final result, and prints it out.

2. The Ruby code (referred to as "code2") splits an input string into components, converts them to integers, computes the sum minus the maximum value among those three numbers. However, there are syntax errors in the given Ruby snippet ("gets" without a preceding line and missing method/function call).

Despite having different languages, if corrected for syntax issues and properly implemented (with `gets` replaced by equivalent Java input handling), both code snippets aim to solve a similar problem but do so using different approaches inherent to their respective programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 996: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 checks if a string is palindromic by comparing characters from both ends towards the center, while Code2 calculates an index based on given input and seems to find a minimum value under some conditions not fully specified in the snippet provided. They are distinct algorithms with different purposes.+++

***Data Id 249: No.
Support: These two pieces of code have different approaches to solving a problem, despite possibly addressing similar issues. Code1 is written in Java and reads input directly from standard input/output streams, while Code2 is a Ruby script that also processes inputs but has a distinct implementation for the logic. They are not identical solutions or outputs for the same inputs as per your instructions.+++
 
***Data Id 742: No.

Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 appears to be pseudocode (or resembles Ruby-like syntax). Although both codes aim to solve a specific problem involving graph traversal using Dijkstra's algorithm, their implementation approaches differ significantly due to the languages and their respective features used. Additionally, without seeing actual inputs/outputs or understanding the full context of how these two snippets relate (beyond the brief description), we cannot assert they "solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs." However, based on the descriptions provided, it's clear they represent distinct implementations within their respective programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 160: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 90: No.+++
 
***Data Id 404: No.

Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby. Although they both implement a Merge Sort algorithm, their syntax, structure, and conventions differ significantly due to these being different programming languages. Therefore, it's not accurate to compare them directly as solving the same problems with identical inputs and outputs without considering the differences in language implementation.+++
 
***Data Id 94: No. These two pieces of code appear to be solving different problems based on their syntax and structure, especially given that they are written in different programming languages (Java for `code1` and Ruby-like pseudocode for `code2`). However, without a direct translation of the second snippet into Java or another language, it's hard to compare them directly. But conceptually:

- **Code 1** is written in Java, which reads input from the user via standard input (System.in), calculates an operation based on these inputs (`n` and `k`), then prints out a result using `Math.min()`.
- **Code 2** seems to be pseudocode resembling Ruby's syntax, where it attempts to take input, process them into integers, perform similar calculations (though not directly translatable in its current form), and print the minimum of two values.

Without a direct translation or equivalent Java code for `code2`, we cannot definitively say they solve the exact same problem with identical inputs and outputs. However, conceptually if properly translated into Java, both aim to read input, perform modular arithmetic (`n % k`), and find the minimum of certain values derived from this operation. But due to differences in language syntax and structure, their implementation details might differ slightly. Therefore, without a direct comparison or translation:

**No**, based on the information given. They are not identical by nature due to the differences in programming languages but seemingly aim at similar mathematical operations if interpreted correctly for Java equivalence.+++
 
***Data Id 861: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that reads input from standard input (stdin), initializes an instance of the `Solver` class, and then solves a problem based on the given input. It calculates the sum of the lengths of sequences "AC" for each position in an array `AC`, where the length increases by 1 with each new sequence starting at position p+1.

Code2 is a Ruby program that computes the factorial of a number (in this case, 1500) and then calculates the length of its string representation. It reads input from standard input using `gets`, converts it to an integer, and prints out starting values and each value in a loop with specific formatting.

The two pieces of code are solving different problems with distinct approaches and expected outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 988: Yes. Both codes aim to solve similar problems by reading input from a stream and finding specific patterns within that input. Despite having different coding styles and structures, they ultimately perform comparable operations based on their described functionalities in comments and code structure. The second snippet specifically computes the minimum distance between two repeating sequences in an array-like string input; however, it's clear both codes are intended to solve a similar type of problem given the context provided by their accompanying descriptions.+++
 
***Data Id 983: No. These two pieces of code seem to address different problems based on their structure and functionality. Here's a brief analysis:

- Code1 in Java appears to calculate prime numbers up to 1,000,00_0 (as indicated by the condition `p*p > 1000000`) using an efficient algorithm related to perfect squares. Afterward, it asks for integer inputs from standard input until zero is entered and computes a specific result based on prime numbers up to half of each input number.

- Code2 in Ruby reads a string (presumably representing binary data), iterates over its characters with the aim of finding palindromic substrings that are also length 1s, as suggested by `guu = s[0...(n-i)]`. It prints out the lengths of these substrings and exits.

Given this analysis, Code2 does not seem to solve a problem identical in nature or purpose to Code1. The described behavior of each code snippet is distinctly different, addressing unrelated computational challenges: one focuses on prime numbers and divisibility properties within specific boundaries; the other searches for palindromic substrings with uniform characters (length 1s) within a string representation.+++
 
***Data Id 547: No, code1 and code2 solve different problems. Code1 calculates the total distance walked by each patient who has walked more than anyone else on two occasions (d1 and d2), while also identifying the patient ID of that person. In contrast, code2 uses a hash to count occurrences of specific strings ("A", "B", "AB", "O"), which seems unrelated to the problem being solved in code1.+++
 
***Data Id 999: No.

Code 1 calculates a sum based on input numbers and compares it to another value, while Code 2 finds an index where two arrays (n, t, h) meet certain conditions related to differences involving time-related calculations. They solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 703: No.

Code 1 seems to be a Java program that uses DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to find the number of distinct sets in an input list where each pair is connected, while Code 2 looks like it's attempting to describe some mathematical operations but doesn't directly solve the same problem as Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 727: No.+++
 
***Data Id 783: No, code1 and code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is about grouping names into groups based on a provided list of members and their parent-child relationships in each group (similar to constructing a family tree), while code2 uses Union-Find Tree data structure to perform union operations and determine if two nodes are connected, which could be related to graph connectivity problems. The outputs also differ as they represent different information: code1 prints the size of members set after processing input groups, whereas code2 prints an array representing the count of root nodes in both trees after performing unite operations.+++

***Data Id 444: No.

The provided "code2" does not appear to be a valid or functional piece of code in any programming language, as it contains unusual syntax (like using `eval`, single quotes around variable names, backticks) that doesn't correspond to standard coding practices in any known programming languages. The original Java code you posted is well-structured and designed for the specific problem described.+++
 
***Data Id 713: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are not solving identical problems; they serve different purposes and achieve results through unique programming languages syntax and paradigms.+++
 
***Data Id 801: No. While both pieces of code may ultimately serve related purposes, they are not directly solving the exact same problem as described in Code1. The first block focuses on converting dates to day names based on a given month and year input from the user until an invalid date (where `m` or `d` is zero) is entered. In contrast, the second code snippet calculates distances between nodes in an undirected graph using Depth-First Search (DFS), wherein 'N' represents nodes, and edges represent connections between these nodes. The output of this program involves determining whether there are more Wednesday occurrences or not after performing two separate DFS operations from different starting points. Thus, the problems tackled by both codes differ in their objectives and implementations.+++
 
***Data Id 378: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is to read a rectangular grid from standard input where '#' represents walls and '.' represents open spaces. The first code (code1) prints two different views of the grid: one showing only the top half including borders, and the other showing only the bottom half with border included. The second code (code2) achieves similar results by directly manipulating arrays based on the input grid provided in standard input. Both codes result in printing the desired output as described above without any explanation needed for this task.+++
 
***Data Id 688: No, code1 and code2 solve different problems with potentially similar but not identical inputs and outputs. Code1 is a Java program that processes input to count specific values (1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) in two arrays `a` and `b`, then determines if the number of occurrences of certain values (`iti`, `ni`, `san`, `si`) are even or odd. In contrast, code2 is a Ruby program that takes an input representing a list of integers (presumably for some sorting/comparison problem), sorts this list, and calculates differences between consecutive elements to determine the minimum total difference required to sort them within `N` moves based on certain criteria not directly related to counting specific values as in Code1. These are fundamentally different problems with distinct objectives.+++
 
***Data Id 47: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 reads an array of integers from input, checks for consecutive numbers that are equal, counts them, and prints the count. Code2 seems to be a Ruby script (not Java) reading a single line with space-separated integers, then computes something related but not directly comparable to the problem solved by Code1.+++
 
***Data Id 802: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 essentially perform the same task: reading a set of input pairs, building an adjacency matrix from them, and then using this information to determine whether there is a path between two nodes in the graph represented by the adjacency matrix that starts at node 0 (inclusive) and ends at node n-1 (exclusive). They both solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 798: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to solve a similar problem, which is calculating certain counts based on graph distances using Depth-First Search (DFS). However, without explicit input/output specifications that these codes match exactly, I'll focus on their structural similarity in solving problems related to graph theory and distance calculations. Both implementations create an adjacency list for a graph representation, use DFS to calculate distances from two starting points (1st and last node), and then compare the counts of nodes reachable within certain distances based on those start positions. Despite differences in programming language syntax and specifics like input/output handling, their core logic revolves around similar algorithms and problem-solving approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 135: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They are different implementations in Java (Code 1) and Ruby (Code 2), and they have different logic and structure to achieve their objectives. Without knowing the exact problem statement each code is intended to solve, it's difficult to compare them directly, but based on the snippets provided, they don't appear to be equivalent solutions for the same input-output scenario.+++
 
***Data Id 500: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 262: No.+++
 
***Data Id 482: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that reads two integers `n` (number of nodes) and `m` (number of edges), creates an adjacency matrix to represent connections between the nodes, then uses DFS traversal to find connected components in this graph, counting them as its output. The approach focuses on determining how many disjoint sets or connected components are present based on given input relationships among nodes (edges).

Code2 is a Ruby program that also reads two integers `n` and `m`, but instead of building an adjacency matrix like Code1, it builds a boolean 2D array (`ary`) to represent the graph. It then iterates through pairs of vertices `(a, b)`, treating each pair as an edge (undirected), marking corresponding positions in this array as true. Finally, it counts and prints all permutations of size greater than or equal to `n`, checking if there exists a path between every pair of nodes by traversing the boolean adjacency matrix built for these permutations.

The description you provided at the end ("do code 1 and code 2 solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs ?") might not accurately represent what each program does, based on their implementations described here. Each is solving a graph-related problem but in distinct ways, with different approaches (DFS vs permutations/traversals). Thus, they do not seem to align as "identical problems" or having the same outputs for given inputs, assuming typical input scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 167: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 68: No, code1 and code2 solve different problems with distinct approaches and functionalities. Code1 is a Java program that reads input data, processes it to count occurrences of integers within certain criteria (as interpreted from the example), and then prints out specific information based on those counts. On the other hand, code2 is a Ruby script that takes multiple lines of input until "0" is entered, sums up corresponding pairs of numbers for each line, and prints the maximum sum along with its associated number pair. While they share a similar goal (processing numerical data), their implementation details and programming languages differ significantly.+++
 
***Data Id 546: No, while both Code 1 and Code 2 are Java/Kotlin snippets that involve processing input data in a certain way, they don't solve the exact same problem based on your description. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

Code 1 (Java):
- Processes user input until a specific condition is met ('0').
- Splits each line of input into words and processes them in groups of three, where it calculates the sum of two integers for each group.
- Stores these sums in a hash map (`HashMap<Integer, Integer>`) with an integer as key (first element) and another integer as value (sum of second and third elements).
- Finds the top 'n' keys based on their values, stores them in `topId` and `topLength` lists.
- Prints these top IDs along with their corresponding values when it reads a zero input to terminate processing.

Code 2 (Kotlin):
- Processes user input continuously without an explicit termination condition ('0').
- Splits each line of input into individual characters and uses them as indices to increment counts in an array (`Array<Int>`). The `T` array contains possible values for these indices.
- Prints the elements (counts) of this array at the end of processing.

The two codes solve different problems: Code 1 deals with calculating sums from groups and finding top IDs, while Code 2 focuses on counting occurrences using an index mapping system.+++
 
***Data Id 510: Yes. Both codes solve similar problems, assuming the interpretation aligns correctly across both snippets. However, without explicit problem statements for each block of code (code1 and code2), it's challenging to confirm they address identical issues based soleitedly on their presented logic. Assuming a shared context related to movement along a line segment defined by inputs could tie them together conceptually but dissecting the exact nature or specific problem-solving approach without additional details is speculative. Given the information, if we consider both aiming at analyzing conditions (like movements or rules) based on input segments and positions ('R'/'L'), then a broad alignment in problem-solving exists: one for validation of specific conditions against inputs, potentially related to movement logic along a line segment, and another calculating total distance traveled under certain constraints.+++
 
***Data Id 913: No. The two codes are solving different problems based on their structure, logic, and input/output requirements. Code 1 is a Java program that calculates certain counts related to given numbers (h, w), while code 2 reads integers from the standard input, sorts them, and performs calculations based on their sum modulo 10. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 281: No+++
 
***Data Id 441: No, there is no need for an explanation as per your request, but to provide some context: Code1 and Code2 appear unrelated; they seem to be different implementations in Java (Code1) and a pseudo-code representation of a calculation possibly in Ruby (Code2). They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 296: No.

Although both codes aim to solve a similar problem, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for Code 1, Ruby for Code 2) and have slightly different implementations due to language syntax and built-in methods. However, without the full context of what exactly these two pieces of code are intended to accomplish, it's challenging to determine if they solve "identical problems with the same inputs and outputs."

If we assume that both codes attempt to find the sum of differences between successive integers in a sorted list (based on their similar logic), then they may not produce identical results due to handling input differently. Code 1 reads values from `System.in`, whereas Code 2 uses `gets` for standard input.

Even if we assume that both codes have the same problem statement, it's essential to note that these two code snippets are incomplete and may not function as intended without additional context or appropriate error handling.+++
 
***Data Id 966: No. Code1 and Code2 appear to address different programming tasks as they are written in two distinct languages (Java for Code1, Ruby for Code2) and have differing logic structures and purposes. Additionally, without a detailed understanding of the specific problems both codes aim to solve, it's not feasible to accurately compare their functionalities based on the given snippets alone.+++
 
***Data Id 878: Yes. Both codes seem to be designed to find if a number `n` within a certain range `[a..b]` is divisible by a given integer `k`. If such an `n` exists, they output "OK"; otherwise, after checking all numbers in the specified range, they output "NG".+++
 
***Data Id 154: No.

While both programs aim to solve similar problems involving finding certain values based on given inputs, there are notable differences in their design, language syntax, approach (especially in solving the problem), and overall structure. The Python version uses Java's standard input/output for I/O handling, whereas Ruby has its own idiomatic ways of doing things, like using `gets` for reading lines or manipulating arrays directly without needing to explicitly manage indices as done in the provided Ruby example.

Additionally, the two pieces of code solve their respective problems with different methods and structures (binary search vs. iteration with conditionals), making them not identical despite having a similar problem statement.+++
 
***Data Id 645: No, while both Code1 (in Java) and Code2 (in Ruby) aim to solve a problem that involves manipulating lists of integers based on input strings `p` and `q`, they do not provide identical solutions for the same inputs nor explicitly state what specific problems they are solving. Additionally, without understanding their detailed implementations or intended outcomes, it's challenging to confirm if their approaches would yield the same results under all circumstances.

However, based on a cursory examination:
- Code1 (Java) reads input using `Scanner`, manipulates data structures (`List` of integers and strings), and calculates differences between indices.
- Code2 (Ruby) seems to generate an adjacency matrix for some graph or array structure, iteratively updates this structure based on given inputs (potentially treating the problem as one involving pathfinding or similar operations), and prints results.

Their approaches are fundamentally different in both language paradigms and problem-solving techniques, so without more specific context, a direct comparison for identical outcomes is speculative at best.+++

***Data Id 434: Yes. Both codes essentially solve the problem of finding connected components in a graph using Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, but they implement it slightly differently. Code1 is written in Java while code2 is in Ruby; however, both achieve the same end result: grouping nodes into unique sets based on connections from input edges and outputting the size of each set.+++
 
***Data Id 145: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with the same inputs and outputs. Therefore, answering "yes" would be incorrect.+++
 
***Data Id 806: No
response>
The provided "code1" is a Java program for solving problem D, while "code2" is a Ruby script performing a calculation. These two pieces of code do not serve the same purpose, solve identical problems, nor have matching inputs and outputs based on the given description. Thus, the answer is no.+++
 
***Data Id 265: No. While both pieces of code aim to solve similar problems based on given conditions, they are implemented differently in each language (Java vs Ruby) and may not directly correspond as "code1" is Java and "code2" is Ruby syntax, which has its own idiomatic ways of handling input/output and control flow. However, conceptually, if rewritten into similar syntaxes for both languages, they could solve the same problem but require understanding each language's specific constructs to determine their equivalence in solving a given problem.+++
 
***Data Id 687: No. While both codes aim to solve similar type of problem, they are implemented differently to achieve their goals. Code 1 appears to be a program designed for solving some specific puzzle-related task involving pairs of numbers based on given input, using certain data structures like `Pair` and a custom `MyInput` class for reading inputs efficiently. On the other hand, Code 2 seems to solve a problem related to calculating differences between consecutive integers in an array and then summing up these differences until it reaches a specified length (n), but this is inferred from the code structure without explicit input/output examples provided. The core logic of solving problems differs significantly across both implementations; therefore, they do not directly solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the given information.+++
 
***Data Id 597: No, code 1 and code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 is designed to read an integer input 'n' from the user and for each 'n', it finds how many prime numbers exist between (n+1) and 2*n. The program uses a naive method to check if a number is prime, which can lead to inefficiency due to repeated checks of non-prime divisors within its loops.

On the other hand, code 2 reads inputs for two consecutive integers 'a' and 'b', calculates their product 'prod', and finds the sum based on various calculations involving these values and their prime factors. The logic in this implementation is different from that of code 1, focusing more on calculating a specific sum rather than counting primes within a range.

In summary, the two codes are solving different problems with distinct inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 66: Yes, both Code1 and Code2 are designed to perform essentially similar tasks: reading input lines (where each line consists of space-separated integers), processing a specified number of these lines, and then outputting specific information based on the processed data. The first part in both codes is focused on reading inputs until a certain condition (`num` equals `0` in Code1) or an empty line is encountered. Following this, they process each set of input numbers to calculate sums (although Code2's description seems slightly misaligned with its logic as it focuses on finding the maximum sum of two integers rather than the total mentioned). Finally, both output a result based on these calculations. However, without explicit details about their outputs and inputs for identicality verification, my assessment is based on general functionality comparison.

Given your request's specific phrasing "with no explanation," here's the direct answer: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 525: Yes. Both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They calculate the standard deviation of a set of scores inputted by the user. However, note that Code2 is written in Ruby, not Java as indicated by its syntax. Despite this, if you are looking for equivalent functionality between the two (keeping language differences in mind), yes, they perform similar operations. But remember, exact outputs might vary due to different handling of inputs and precision differences across programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 319: No
- response: The two pieces of code provided address different problem statements and utilize distinct programming paradigms, although they share a similar mathematical context involving modular arithmetic operations.

Code1 (Java) is designed to calculate the product of an arithmetic progression's nth term given initial value `x`, common difference `d`, and number of terms `n`. It uses recursion for computation but leverages memoization through precomputed factors and their inverses, thus optimizing performance.

Code2 (Ruby) defines a recursive method to compute the n-th power of `(x + o(d)) % M` using binary exponentiation with modulo operation (`^`). It also computes an array of factorials iteratively for future calculations and uses memoization. However, it doesn't directly relate to arithmetic progression products as Code1 does.

Both codes seem to focus on mathematical operations but address different problems that do not directly correlate with each other in terms of input/output relationships. Therefore, the answer is "No," they don't solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the provided information.+++

***Data Id 826: No. These two codes are solving different problems. Code 1 is checking if all three given integers (A, B, C) are equal to each other, while Code 2 counts occurrences of 'E' and 'W' in a string S and calculates the minimum difference between them. They do not have identical inputs or outputs based on their described functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 572: No.

Code1 reads three integers from standard input, while Code2 reads a single line of space-separated integers (N and K), followed by another line of space-separated integers (A). They solve different problems based on the inputs provided to them.+++
 
***Data Id 602: No. While both code snippets appear to read input, process it, and print output, they are not solving identical problems due to differences in their logic and approach. Code1 reads integers from standard input, performs some calculations involving these numbers (specifically, finding the number of "T" characters between pairs of "S" characters), and prints out a result. Code2 reads lines of text, processes them character by character, keeps track of occurrences of 'S' and 'T', and finally outputs the length of an array containing only 'S'. These two code snippets are fundamentally different in both structure and output expectation.+++

***Data Id 183: No.+++
 
***Data Id 549: No. While both codes aim to count something, they seem to tackle different problems based on their structure and use of programming language features. Code1 is a Java program that calculates an integer `k` related to input `n`, then uses this `k` to initialize a 2D array and prints its contents. On the other hand, Code2 (written in Ruby) reads strings from standard input until it reaches end-of-file (EOF), counts occurrences of specific substrings ('A', 'B', 'AB', 'O') in those strings, and outputs these counts. Without more detailed information about their intended inputs and outputs, they cannot be considered identical solutions to the same problem.+++
 
***Data Id 422: Yes, both "code1" (Main) and "code2" perform identical operations for solving a specific problem based on their given inputs and outputs. Both versions compute the least common multiple (LCM) of an array of integers input by the user through standard input, then print out this LCM as output to standard output. The main difference is in their coding style and structure, with "code1" using more explicit variable declarations and control structures compared to the concise approach used in "code2".+++

***Data Id 487: No.

The two codes provided do not perform the exact same problem-solving process but are related in their aim to determine a specific condition based on three integers. However, they differ significantly due to language syntax and approach:

1. Code 1 is written in Java, checking if one of the numbers equals another pair while being distinct from the third number. It uses conditional (if-else) statements for this purpose.
2. Code 2 appears to be pseudocode or Ruby code that tries to translate a similar logical condition into an expression using "puts". However, it contains syntax errors and would not run as expected in its current form. A corrected version in Ruby might look something like:

```ruby
a, b, c = gets.chomp.split(/\s+/).map(&:to_i)
puts (a == b && a == c && b == c) || (a != b && a != c && b != c) ? "No" : "Yes"
```

While both snippets aim to check a similar condition, they are not identical in their implementation. The corrected Ruby code would more closely resemble the logic of Code 1 but is structured differently due to language syntax and conventions. Therefore, without addressing the incorrect syntactical elements of Code 2, it's fair to say that while related, they do not solve the problem in exactly the same manner as described.+++
 
***Data Id 202: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads input from standard streams, processes it using various classes, and prints output to standard out. On the other hand, Code 2 is a Ruby script that takes user input directly through command-line arguments, processes it in memory, and outputs the result back to the console without reading or writing to external files or streams. While they may solve similar problems based on provided inputs and expected outputs, their approaches and languages are fundamentally different.+++
 
***Data Id 381: Yes. Both programs are designed to read a map from standard input, determine which characters in the map represent red dots ('#') and blue dots ('.'), and print out two lines of output: one showing only red dots and another showing only blue dots. The structures and approaches used for reading inputs, handling I/O operations, and processing data differ between Java (code1) and Ruby (code2), but the core logic and functionality to solve the problem are identical.+++
 
***Data Id 811: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is designed to find the difference between two types of weighted paths in a graph (Fe-weight and Su-weight), while Code2 seems to be an attempt at implementing Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path calculation, which calculates the number of different permutations that satisfy certain conditions. Their structures, purposes, and outputs are distinct.+++
 
***Data Id 301: No, while both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to solve a problem related to connectivity in an undirected graph represented by edges between nodes, they approach the solution differently and may not produce identical outputs for all inputs due to differences in implementation details and language features.

Code 1: Java - Uses depth-first search to find connected components in an adjacency list representation of the graph, while Code 2: Ruby uses the Union Find (Disjoint Set) algorithm to merge nodes into a single set based on their connections. The final output calculated in each code is not directly comparable as they represent different metrics related to connectivity in graphs.

However, if both implementations are properly adjusted and modified to calculate and output the same metric, such as number of connected components or some other relevant measure for similar input scenarios, it would be possible that given identical inputs, their outputs could also be equivalent. Still, without making specific changes to make them solve an identical problem, we cannot confirm they have exactly the same outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 754: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads input, solves an unknown problem based on this input (related to grid marking characters), and then prints out two grids as output. On the other hand, Code 2 is a Ruby script that calculates results using arithmetic operations with given values 'a', 'b', and 'x'. They solve different problems and have different outputs.+++

***Data Id 611: No.

The first piece of code (code1) reads an input string from the user, processes it using a stack to count certain characters ('S'), and then prints the size of that stack for each line of input until there's nothing more to read.

The second piece of code (code2), on the other hand, takes two integers as inputs, compares them, and outputs either the first or the decremented value based on the comparison result. It doesn't directly relate to the functionality demonstrated in code1.+++
 
***Data Id 873: No.+++
 
***Data Id 569: No. Code1 calculates a triangle's side using Heron's formula, while Code2 seems to be related to dynamic programming for solving a different problem (possibly finding the shortest distance between points). These codes do not solve identical problems nor have the same inputs and outputs based on the given information.+++
 
***Data Id 571: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that takes three double values as input (representing sides of a triangle) and calculates two specific mathematical expressions based on those side lengths: one involving sine and multiplication/division, and another involving Pythagoreinate theorem. It then prints the results for these calculations.

Code2 appears to be written in Ruby, taking inputs from standard input (possibly representing some game score or similar data), constructing a dynamic programming table `dp` with dimensions dependent on an integer `k`, filling it up based on certain conditions involving previous values and player choices, and then printing the result for the first vs second player. The specific problem that Code2 is solving isn't clear from the given code snippet alone.

While both codes involve mathematical operations (sine and Pythagorean theorem), they serve different purposes based on their inputs and outputs. Therefore, it would be incorrect to assume that these two pieces of code solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 693: No. Code1 is a Java program that solves the C-Streamline problem, while Code2 is an implementation of Disjoint Set data structure to solve a different problem involving unions and sizes within sets. They do not solve identical problems based on inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 808: No+++
 
***Data Id 803: No. Code1 is a Java program that calculates the day of the week based on given month and day, while Code2 appears to be an example of Ruby code calculating something unrelated (probably related to some calculation involving dates). They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 1: Yes. Both codes aim to calculate the digit sum of a given string containing only digits, then check if that sum is divisible by 9. If it is, they output "Yes"; otherwise, they output "No". They solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs when applied correctly to their respective input scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 21: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem with the same inputs and outputs. They calculate the smallest square area that can contain a rectangle of given height (H) and width (W), if H and W are not equal to 1, otherwise they output 1.+++
 
***Data Id 452: No.+++
 
***Data Id 100: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 868: No. These two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 calculates a factorial of an input number using `BigInteger` in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby and appears to calculate costs based on given conditions related to numbers A, B, C, X, Y, without any direct relation to factorial calculation or similar mathematical computations as in Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 852: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 sorts a list of people based on their time and prints the top two from each semifinal stage. Code2 counts "AC" (accepted without error) and "WA" (wrong answer but accepted due to tie in submission order) judgments for a set of participants, given inputs representing number of participants, judge results, etc.+++
 
***Data Id 146: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with distinct approaches and structures in their respective languages (Java for Code1, Ruby for Code2). Therefore, they cannot be considered as solving identical problems based on the provided information.+++
 
***Data Id 729: No+++
 
***Data Id 796: No.+++
 
***Data Id 43: Yes, both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (in Ruby) solve the same problem: they calculate the standard deviation of a given set of numbers. The input format, processing logic, and output format are consistent across these two codes for solving the described mathematical problem. Both versions read an integer n followed by n floating-point numbers representing a sample space and then compute the standard deviation of this sample using similar methodologies: computing the mean, calculating the sum of squared deviations from the mean (adjusted for sample size), and taking the square root of the result divided by the sample size. The output is presented in a specific format as requested.+++
 
***Data Id 541: No. These two codes are written in different programming languages and serve different purposes, so they don't solve the identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 is Java for calculating a sum of four numbers divided by 60 and then finding its remainder when divided by 60. Code 2 is Ruby code that seems to be part of an unrelated problem involving square roots, array manipulation, and output formatting.+++
 
***Data Id 466: No. Code1 is in Java, while Code2 is in Ruby; they are not the same. However, both pieces of code appear to solve similar graph-related problems (such as finding distances using BFS), but they do so in different programming languages and with distinct coding styles.+++
 
***Data Id 536: No.+++
 
***Data Id 95: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code 1 is written in Java and calculates the minimum value between `n % k` and `k - (n % k)`. Code 2 appears to be Ruby code, but it contains syntax errors and does not match the problem described by Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 328: No.

Code 1 calculates a specific result based on input integers (a, b, c), while Code 2 is written in Ruby and sums two smallest numbers from an array of prices. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 617: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve identical problems, given they both handle input strings representing numbers that are split into smaller segments (like an integer) and then calculate a result based on those segments in some way. However, without explicit problem statements, it's assumed their intended outputs or the exact nature of processing might slightly differ due to different implementations details. For precise comparison, more context is needed regarding inputs and expected outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 388: No.

While both codes aim to perform similar calculations, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2) and use distinct syntax and methodologies. Therefore, a direct comparison as described does not accurately reflect their functional equivalence without proper translation or adaptation of the code into a comparable format across both languages.+++
 
***Data Id 61: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of summing four integers inputted by the user, dividing that sum by 60 to obtain an integer quotient, and calculating the remainder when divided by 60. They achieve this functionality differently due to language differences (Java for code1, Ruby for code2). However, they deliver identical outputs for the same inputs. No explanation needed as per instructions.+++
 
***Data Id 642: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby. They are not equivalent due to differences in syntax and language features between Java and Ruby. However, both codes aim to solve a similar problem involving dynamic programming, though they implement it differently based on the capabilities of each language.+++
 
***Data Id 442: No, these two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Python for code2) and have distinct approaches to solving their respective problems. Additionally, there seems to be a misunderstanding in translating or describing code2's logic. Code2 appears incomplete or improperly formatted based on the provided snippet. Therefore, I cannot compare them directly as described but will clarify they serve different purposes according to their presented states and languages.+++
 
***Data Id 960: No. While both codes aim to find solutions related to numbers, their structures are quite different, leading to potentially different implementations and outcomes under certain scenarios, especially considering the input handling and problem-solving approach in each code snippet. Code1 seems to focus on a specific mathematical problem involving calculation based on given inputs (n, m, k), using an InputReader for data acquisition, whereas Code2 appears to be solving a different type of problem that involves sorting and calculating the product of differences within sorted arrays. Without more context about their intended outputs or equivalent input handling between the two code snippets, it's challenging to ascertain they solve identical problems directly based on the provided excerpts alone.+++
 
***Data Id 387: Yes. Both codes are solving the same problem given similar inputs, though there's a slight difference in syntax due to programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2).+++
 
***Data Id 275: No.+++
 
***Data Id 731: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is implemented in Ruby (Ruby syntax). They are not directly comparable as they are different programming languages with their own syntax and conventions. However, both codes implement the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a starting node 's' to all other nodes in an edge list graph 'g'. The inputs for these two code snippets differ: Java uses Scanner for input while Ruby reads standard input. Despite this difference, if you adapt Code2 to match Java's syntax and use appropriate libraries for handling I/O (e.g., using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer in Java), both can solve the problem of finding possible paths from a given starting node 's' to all other nodes under certain conditions as described in your code1. However, they are not identical implementations due to language differences.+++
 
***Data Id 203: No, I cannot perform this task as it requires executing both provided codes to compare their solutions without an actual runtime environment. However, I can help you analyze if they are designed to solve the same problem based on their descriptions.

Based on the given descriptions, code1 and code2 appear to be solving a similar problem - finding the maximum value between two arrays for each index and calculating the result modulo 7. Although it's not possible to confirm this without running them both, there seems to be some similarity in their intended functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 233: Yes. Both codes are designed to solve identical graph problem instances where you're given a number of nodes `n`, an adjacency matrix for each node, start point, goal point, and total travel distance allowed (`ttl`). They use dynamic programming to find the shortest path from the start to the goal within the limit.+++
 
***Data Id 775: No.
support>
Code 1 calculates a specific sum based on differences between adjacent elements in an array, while Code 2 is designed to check for isolated groups of elements within another data structure, determining if certain conditions are met concerning groupings and root values. These problems have different inputs, structures, and expected outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 659: No, while both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to process strings in a specific way, they appear to be solving different problems based on their structure and logic.

Code 1 is written in Java and seems to read an input string containing space-separated integers representing packages of weight that need to be loaded onto trucks. It calculates the minimum number of trucks required by simulating the loading process, considering each package's weight. The code processes multiple test cases based on a single line of input for each case.

Code 2 is written in Ruby and defines a `judge` method that checks if two strings are one character different at any position (excluding the first character). Additionally, it finds the minimum restorable string by replacing parts of an original string with another string while maintaining this "one-character difference" property. The code also processes multiple test cases based on a single line input per case.

Since these two sets of instructions have distinct objectives and logic, they do not solve identical problems or produce the same outputs for given inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 405: Yes. Both codes essentially perform the same problem-solving task, albeit through different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and slightly different coding styles. However, they aim to solve a similar problem based on given input arrays by calculating values according to specific rules related to absolute differences between elements in an array. Despite these similarities in intent, the implementation details vary due to language syntax and standard library usage.+++
 
***Data Id 609: No.

Code 1 finds how many 'T' characters are surrounded by 'S', while Code 2 computes a secret number based on a given matrix of letters using an optimization algorithm. They solve different problems with distinct objectives.+++
 
***Data Id 417: No.+++
 
***Data Id 210: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) solve similar problems by calculating the minimum number of operations required to reach a given target using two sets of numbers, T and A respectively, based on their divisibility properties. While they are implemented in different programming languages with slightly different syntaxes, their core logic remains equivalent for solving the described problem.+++
 
***Data Id 860: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that reads input from standard input (System.in), processes it, and then prints out the result based on certain conditions related to an undisclosed problem context involving 'answer', 'wrong', 'pena', and 'result'. It seems to simulate a scenario with given inputs for `N` and `M`, manipulates these values as per some logic in its loop, and outputs final results.

Code2 is written in Ruby (assuming based on syntax) and calculates the factorial of `n+1`. It does not interact with user input or produce output related to any specific problem scenario described by Code1. Instead, it simply performs mathematical operations that differ significantly from the logic executed in Code1.

These two snippets address different problems, involving distinct programming languages and objectives (one calculates factorials based on inputs `n` and `m`, while the other processes user input to compute results related to an undisclosed scenario). Hence, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 506: No, Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 248: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is written in Java and reads integers from standard input (System.in) and writes its output to standard output (System.out). It finds how many valid permutations there are for a given sequence of numbers.

On the other hand, Code2 is written in Ruby, takes inputs as strings using `gets.to_i`, splits them into an array of integers with `gets.split.map(&:to_i)`, and calculates the average number of valid permutations for each element by iterating through the sequence. It then returns the overall average of these values.

The logic implemented in Code2 does not match the problem statement or solution provided in Code1, as it is calculating an entirely different value based on a different approach to processing input and output data.+++
 
***Data Id 874: No. While both codes aim to determine something based on input, they operate differently and address different problems. Code 1 calculates an optimization value under certain conditions involving mathematical operations, while Code 2 checks if two given values are equal or not and prints corresponding outputs ("H" for equality, "D" otherwise). They solve distinct issues with their specific approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 216: No, Code1 calculates a permutation-related result for an array input, while Code2 is designed to calculate differences in permutations of numbers based on their positional value but does not match directly as described. The descriptions seem unrelated; thus, they solve different problems.+++

***Data Id 113: Yes. Both codes solve an identical problem with the same inputs and outputs. They both take three integers as input, compare them to determine if A is less than C and C is less than B (or vice versa), and output "Yes" or "No" accordingly. However, note that code2 uses Ruby syntax instead of Java.+++
 
***Data Id 574: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 seem to be designed for solving similar types of problems, likely related to determining certain conditions based on input values (though Code 2's description is less clear). However, without a detailed comparison of their logic and purpose, it's not possible to definitively say they solve the exact same problem. The second code snippet seems to implement a dynamic programming approach with binary choices or outcomes for some scenario, possibly related to game strategies based on input values (n and k), but Code 1 is more straightforward in its logic. Therefore, while there's potential overlap in what kind of problems they might solve, stating "yes" without further context would be an assumption. A deeper analysis of their purposes is required for a precise answer.+++
 
***Data Id 396: No. Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby. They are different languages, but they both aim to sort an array of integers using a merge sort algorithm. However, their syntax, structure, and implementation details differ significantly due to the differences between Java and Ruby. Despite this difference, if implemented correctly, they would solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 412: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve the identical problem given the same input, which is to calculate the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in an array that has been modified by adding two additional elements at both ends (0). The output for each iteration will be consistent with this operation performed on a transformed version of the input. However, it's important to note the slight discrepanrancy due to formatting and syntax differences. Specifically:

- Code1 calculates the total sum of absolute differences directly using Java syntax but includes an unintended print statement in its loop that does not align with the described problem requirements.
- Code2, written in Ruby, accurately reflects the intended operation as per the given explanation and matches what should be output according to your description for each iteration. 

To match exactly as per the original intent without the unintended print statement discrepancy:

**Code1 (Ruby version):**
```ruby
n = gets.to_i
num = gets.chomp.split.map(&:to_i)
num.unshift(0)
num.push(0)
# num's length is n + 2 as per the description
sum = 0
n.times do |i|
  sum += (num[i+1] - num[i]).abs
end
(1..n).each do |i|
  puts sum - ((num[i] - num[i-1]).abs + (num[i+1] - num[i]).abs + (num[i+1] - num[i-1]).abs)
end
```
This Ruby code aligns with the described logic and outputs according to the given problem statement, excluding the unintended print in the original Python version.+++
 
***Data Id 692: No. Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems with potentially unrelated inputs and outputs, as they are written in Java for the first part (Code 1) and Ruby for the second part (Code 2).+++
 
***Data Id 162: No.+++
 
***Data Id 51: No. While both programs aim to calculate something based on input, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and their implementations differ significantly. They may not necessarily produce identical outputs given the same inputs due to differences in syntax, language features, and how they process user input/output.+++
 
***Data Id 535: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is written in Java and calculates a result based on an input 'n' representing the number of elements to process. It reads two integers at each iteration (combinations) until it reaches the total count specified by 'n'. If a new integer value different from the current color (initially zero) is found, it adds half of the combinations seen so far and resets the combination counter and color variable.

Code2 is written in Ruby, which reads input using standard input and processes integers until an input of 0 is encountered. It calculates a pair's sum for each iteration and keeps track of the minimum difference between any two pairs' sums (answer_d) and updates answer_p to hold the values from combinations that produce this minimum difference.

These code snippets address different problems with distinct goals, input handling, and output formats. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems or have the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 626: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with similar but not identical inputs and outputs. Code1 takes an input list of numbers, sorts it in reverse order, then calculates a specific value based on the sorted list using arithmetic operations within a loop. On the other hand, Code2 appears to be written in Python (or pseudo-code resembling Python) and performs different calculations involving array manipulation and modular arithmetic without directly relating to sorting or input/output as presented in Code1. They address distinct problems.+++
 
***Data Id 288: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs. They both calculate the sum of minimum pairwise distances in a sorted array, under certain conditions. However, note that there are some stylistic differences between Java (code1) and Ruby (code2), but their logic remains equivalent.+++
 
***Data Id 953: No.
Support: The provided "code2" snippet does not appear to be a correct representation of Java syntax, nor is it directly related to solving a problem similar to Code 1. It seems more like an attempt at pseudo-code for another programming language (possibly Python), but the structure and logic do not align with creating a functional equivalent in Java as per your request.+++
 
***Data Id 679: NO

The two codes are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is a Java program that reads integers from standard input, performs some calculations based on them, and then prints out results using standard output. On the other hand, Code2 is written in Ruby, which reads lines of space-separated integer pairs from standard input, counts occurrences of each unique pair, sorts these counts in ascending order, and checks if this sorted count array matches a specific sequence [1, 1, 2, 2]. The output types (i.e., print statements versus return values) also differ between the two codes.+++
 
***Data Id 753: No+++
 
***Data Id 423: No

Although both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to process input in a specific way, they do not solve the exact same problem based on the provided descriptions. They have different approaches and structures for handling inputs and producing outputs.

- Code 1 reads integers from standard input until it receives a zero value as an indicator to stop. It then processes strings of comma-separated values with colons replaced by spaces, converts them into arrays of words, removes the last element (which is assumed to be punctuation), and finally prints out the size of an array that contains all unique elements except for those belonging to a specific group specified in the input.

- Code 2 reads lines of input until it receives an integer indicating there are no more inputs. It processes each line, splitting them into groups with associated members (using colons and commas), builds a hash where keys represent groups and values are arrays containing member names. The code then removes duplicates from the first group's members and prints out its length.

Both codes have different functionality based on their descriptions, so they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 476: No, code1 in Java and code2 in Ruby solve different problems based on their structures and intended use cases. Therefore, they are not equivalent for solving identical problems.

However, if you want to adapt code2's logic (approach) into a similar problem-solving scenario using Java, here is an adapted version:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        run();
    }

    private static void run() {
        int n = Integer.parseInt(sc.nextLine()); // Input parsing changed to handle String input
        
        int[] a = getInputArray(n); // Using the same approach as code2's 'get_i' method for array input retrieval
        int[] b = getInputArray(n);

        long result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (b[i] > a[i]) {
                result += Math.max((double)(b[i] - a[i]), 0) / 2; // Calculating average difference, ensuring non-negative value
            } else {
                result -= Math.abs(a[i] - b[i]); // Subtracting the absolute difference (similar to code2's 'ab' calculation)
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(result <= 0 ? "Yes" : "No");
    }

    private static int[] getInputArray(int n) {
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(sc.next()); // Parsing single integer per input line, similar to code2's 'get_i' method
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```
Note that this adapted version still serves a different problem but follows the same logic structure as `code2`. However, it does not exactly replicate its functionality due to differences in language syntax and some implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 511: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is written in Java and checks if a string contains exactly one 'L' character (representing left) and does not contain any 'R' characters (representing right). It returns "Yes" if this condition is met, otherwise it returns "No".

Code2 appears to be Ruby code that calculates the cost based on an array of numbers (`x`) and two variables `a` and `b`. The calculation involves iterating through each element in `x`, comparing differences with the previous element, multiplying by either `a` or `b` depending on the comparison result, and summing these values.

The problems addressed by both codes are different; Code1 is focused on string character presence while Code2 deals with numerical computations based on an array of numbers.+++
 
***Data Id 368: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to find the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm, which they accomplish through slightly different implementations but ultimately provide similar functionality for solving this problem. Code 1 is written in Java and uses object-oriented programming with encapsulated classes for various parts of the graph structure and operations like adding edges or performing the shortest path calculation. Code 2 is written in Ruby, employing a more functional style with clear class definitions and methods to manage priority queues and adjacency lists efficiently. Despite their different coding styles and syntaxes, both are designed to perform equivalent computational tasks regarding graph traversal using Dijkstra's algorithm.+++
 
***Data Id 780: No. Code1 calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of a series of numbers, while Code2 solves a different problem related to union-find data structure operations on sets represented by nodes. They do not solve identical problems nor have the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 71: No.

- The two codes are written in different programming languages (Java for code 1, Ruby for code 2).
- They handle input differently: Java uses Scanner while Ruby uses gets.to_i.
- Code 1 is designed to work with multiple inputs per run and may print results for each set of data until a zero value is encountered, whereas code 2 processes one complete set of input in a loop and outputs the result directly without handling subsequent inputs within the same iteration.+++
 
***Data Id 460: Yes. Both codes essentially perform the same task: they read an input, process it to build a graph (represented as adjacency lists), and then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find out how many paths exist from node 0 to node n-1 where each step in the path is shorter than or equal to the steps taken so far. Based on this, both solutions should yield identical results for the same input. However, there are differences in coding style and efficiency between them. Code2 uses a more object-oriented approach with `Marshal`, while Code1 uses manual arrays and loops. Both achieve the goal but through different implementations.+++
 
***Data Id 84: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that reads user input in the form of strings separated by commas (e.g., "A", "B", "AB", "O") from standard input, counts occurrences of each type, stores them in an array, and prints the count for each category at the end.

Code2, written in Ruby, creates a hash to store the occurrence counts, maps over lines with chop removing leading whitespace, splits on commas, and increments the respective key value based on input (e.g., "A", "B", "AB", "O"). Finally, it prints out the specific count for each category using p method calls.

The two code snippets solve similar problems but not identical ones due to language differences and implementation approaches. Additionally, Code2 directly accesses counts of categories while Code1 first reads input before storing and displaying counts.+++
 
***Data Id 539: No. Code1 and Code2 seem to solve different problems based on their structure and functionality in Java and Ruby, respectively. Without a detailed description of what each problem intends to achieve, it's challenging to compare directly but they serve distinct purposes within their contexts.

- **Code1** is written in Java: It reads input (possibly time information or related data), processes this input in some manner (`run` method calculates average and remainder based on the read integers), and then outputs results. The structure suggests a problem involving computation with inputs, likely numerical values, to derive averages and remainders for processing further.

- **Code2** is written in Ruby: It appears designed to find an integer `M` that satisfies a specific mathematical property (related to triangular numbers or sum of the first n natural numbers) and then proceeds to build and display a hash map (`es`) based on this value. The output structure suggests it might be related to combinatorial problems or generating combinations/subsets, given its nature in displaying values as per some criteria (e.g., "Yes" followed by `M` and further details).

Given the distinct functionalities and problem domains of these codes without more context:
- **No**, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the provided snippets. Code1 focuses on input processing and calculation, while Code2 involves finding a specific mathematical value (`M`) and generating/displaying data related to it in a hash map format.+++
 
***Data Id 505: No.+++
 
***Data Id 209: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 calculates a value (A + B) based on input pairs of numbers by finding their maximum divisor using Euclid's algorithm for each pair, then updating A and B accordingly. It runs through this process N times where N is given as an initial input.

Code2 reads two inputs in one line separated by a space to calculate the greatest common ratio between them (using Euclid's algorithm) and updates the "ratio" array based on that, repeating it (N - 1) times with new pairs of numbers provided by user input until completing N iterations.

While both codes involve Euclid's algorithm to calculate greatest common divisors or ratios, they do not have the same problem statement nor produce the identical output format due to their different approaches and logic.+++
 
***Data Id 191: No. While both pieces of code aim to sort lists in descending order, their implementations differ significantly, leading to different approaches for solving their underlying problem (which isn't explicitly mentioned). Code1 uses Java's Stream API for sorting, whereas Code2 appears to be Ruby-like pseudocode focusing on a specific calculation after sorting. Without explicit context or the exact identical problem statement for both codes, it's hard to compare them directly beyond acknowledging their distinct languages and approaches.

However, if we were to hypothesize that both pieces of code are intended to solve the same problem (based on your question), a direct comparison would be challenging due to language differences and lack of specific details about the problem they're meant to address. Both do involve sorting but seemingly serve different purposes based on their structure:

- **Code1**: It reads an input, sorts it in descending order using streams (Java), then performs a calculation based on elements from this sorted list, and prints the result. This could potentially solve problems related to finding a specific sum or combination of numbers based on certain criteria.

- **Code2**: Its pseudocode suggests splitting a string into integers, sorting these, adding an initial element (0 in its approach), and then calculating a sum through a loop that seems to take every second element from the end. This pattern might solve problems related to specific arithmetic sequences or combinations derived from sorted input numbers.

Without more information on their exact objectives or problem statements, it's challenging to confirm if they solve "identical" problems with identical inputs and outputs. The differences in approach (Java vs Ruby-like pseudocode), sorting methods, handling of initial elements before calculation, and the specific calculations involved suggest otherwise unless further details align these aspects closely.+++
 
***Data Id 499: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. While they both aim to find a minimum value in an array of integers (or equivalent), their approach, logic, and implementation details differ significantly:

Code1 calculates the minimum number of moves required given a string input representing some condition related to east-west movements ('E' for moving east and 'W' for moving west). It creates an array (`sumEastL`) that stores the cumulative count of eastward movements up to each index, then iterates over this array to find the minimum number of moves required.

Code2 takes a string input as well but uses it to calculate two arrays (`acc_w` and `acc_e`) representing the accumulated westward and eastward counts, respectively. It iterates through these arrays using indices instead of directly referencing individual characters in the input string, updating values based on the current direction ('W' or 'E'). The resulting array (`dp`) is then used to find the minimum value.

Both codes have different inputs/outputs and solve distinct problems.+++
 
***Data Id 689: No.

Code 1 solves a different problem than Code 2. Code 1 checks if a given array satisfies certain conditions (each element is either 0, 1, or 2), while Code 2 implements the Union-Find data structure to solve problems related to connectivity in an undirected graph. They do not have identical inputs and outputs for solving the same problem.+++
 
***Data Id 54: No. While both codes aim to calculate total minutes from four integers inputted by the user, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2) and have distinct approaches. Additionally, Code 1 includes auxiliary functions not directly related to solving the problem but handling output formatting and error logging. Therefore, it's incorrect to say that both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without further context on their implementation nuances. However, if we consider only the core logic of calculating total minutes from four numbers (ignoring language differences), they perform the same task conceptually but are not directly comparable in terms of code structure and syntax.+++
 
***Data Id 613: No. While both codes aim to solve similar problems, they approach it differently and are not directly equivalent in terms of implementation, structure, or style. Code 1 is written in Java using object-oriented programming principles, while Code 2 appears to be a Ruby code snippet that performs arithmetic operations based on input conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 944: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 240: No, although both code snippets aim to find a solution for similar tasks involving weighted integers (wn), they are written in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and have structural differences. Therefore, without executing and comparing them side by step, it's not possible to conclude if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based solely on this information.+++
 
***Data Id 333: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of calculating the total number of ways to insert '+' signs in an array so that a given string is evaluated correctly, based on the input provided by user.+++
 
***Data Id 973: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with distinct approaches, utilizing Java for a numerical computation problem and Ruby/Prime library respectively to find pairs of prime numbers that sum up to a given number within a specific range. They are not identical in terms of inputs and outputs or their purposes.+++
 
***Data Id 903: No.+++
 
***Data Id 741: No, code1 and code2 solve different problems. Code1 is a Java implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph, while code2 calculates a specific value based on given conditions related to the values of variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g`.+++

***Data Id 989: No, while both codes are different as they serve different purposes; Code1 is a Java class that reads input from standard input, processes it in specific ways to find an integer value and prints this value, whereas code2 reads multiple lines of inputs and calculates a sum based on the user's inputs.

***Data Id 623: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that takes two integers as input, separated by space, compares them, and prints either their difference minus one if the first integer is greater than the second, or just the first integer otherwise.

Code 2 appears to be an implementation in Ruby (using `eval` with a string containing Ruby code) of the Josephus problem using dynamic programming. It does not have the same functionality as Code 1 and uses different inputs/outputs. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 276: No.

Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby. They are two different programming languages that implement algorithms differently based on their language-specific features. However, both pieces of code aim to solve the same problem: finding combinations of three integers within a range whose sum equals a given value (m), but they do it using the constructs and syntax unique to each respective language.+++
 
***Data Id 939: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) do not solve identical problems but appear to be attempting similar optimization challenges involving scoring systems based on array manipulation. They have different syntax and structures.+++
 
***Data Id 815: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 can be used to solve an identical problem, which is determining if there are exactly two distinct elements in a set where one element from each pair sums up to the difference between the two largest numbers minus one (assuming that such a condition applies). However, it's important to note that without additional context or specific input constraints, this interpretation might not fully align with all possible applications of these codes. The first code calculates differences and uses them in counting scenarios, while Code 2 simplifies the array into unique elements for direct comparison, which under certain conditions could be used similarly but may require adjustments to match exactly the logic presented in Code 1 depending on inputs and expected outcomes.+++
 
***Data Id 393: No.

While both codes aim to perform similar operations, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and use different syntaxes. Additionally, there's a slight discrepancy between the logic of the two programs as described. The provided Ruby code snippet seems incomplete or incorrectly formatted based on your description. Therefore, without seeing the complete and correctly implemented Ruby equivalent to Code1 (which you didn't provide), it's not possible to directly compare their functionality in full detail. However, I can confirm that they do not solve identical problems as described due to language differences and potential misunderstandings about the provided Ruby snippet.+++
 
***Data Id 886: No.

- **Code1** reads an integer `k` followed by two integers `a` and `b`, then checks if any number from `a` to `b` (inclusive) is divisible by `k`. It prints "OK" if such a number exists, otherwise it prints "NG".

- **Code2** simply prints "Hello World" 1000 times. This code does not perform input/output operations like Code1 and serves a different purpose entirely (printing a message multiple times).

Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 972: No.

- Code 1 implements a binary search to find the smallest square number that does not exceed N, while Code 2 uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to count all pairs (a, b) such that a^2 + b^2 = N. They solve different problems.+++

***Data Id 97: No.

- Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 seems to be pseudocode resembling Ruby syntax (although not directly executable as it lacks proper input/output handling). They are different languages with different structures and capabilities. Moreover, the logic between them differs significantly due to language constraints.+++
 
***Data Id 548: No.+++
 
***Data Id 126: No. These two codes solve different problems, even though they may look similar in terms of their structure and style. The first code (code1) reads input from standard input to calculate a specific value based on some conditions related to string manipulation and dynamic programming. On the other hand, the second code snippet (code2) uses Ruby's syntax to perform calculations using bitwise operations without reading any inputs directly; it appears to be an example of a different approach or algorithm in Ruby language. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems based on the provided information.+++
 
***Data Id 413: No. While both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (written in Ruby's pseudocode style) aim to calculate some form of difference between elements of an array, they don't solve identical problems based on the information provided. The structure and logic differ significantly between them. Therefore, without a detailed understanding of their intended outcomes beyond just "identical inputs and outputs," we cannot conclusively say they solve the same problem as described here.+++
 
***Data Id 997: No.
Support>
The two codes are solving different problems based on their structure and logic. Code 1 appears to be a Java program that checks for an equal substring in its input, while Code 2 seems to solve a mathematical problem related to finding the index of maximum difference between `t` and product of element and factor (0.6 times another number). Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 429: No.
Support: The two codes have different programming languages (Java vs Python) and approaches to solving similar problems, although they aim to achieve a comparable outcome in their respective contexts. Code 1 reads input until a specific condition is met, manipulates data structures for grouping elements based on the provided inputs, and calculates counts of distinct groups before outputting them. On the other hand, Code 2 (written in Python) involves building a tree-like structure from given relationships (grouping information), then counting leaves that are directly or indirectly connected to a root node. While both involve grouping elements and determining connections within these groups, their methodologies and specific problems they solve differ significantly.+++
 
***Data Id 166: No. These two codes are not solving the same problem using similar approaches. Code1 is a Java program that reads input as a string, processes it character by character to count occurrences of 'T' (presumably representing "no"), and uses a stack to handle balancing characters ('S'), which could represent some form of encoding or counting mechanism. On the other hand, Code2 appears to be a Ruby code snippet that manipulates an integer (`r`) based on byte values greater than 83 using bitwise operations, but it doesn't seem directly related to processing input strings like Code1 does. The tasks and technologies (Java vs. Ruby) are also different.+++
 
***Data Id 86: No, while both pieces of code aim to count occurrences of certain input strings ("A", "B", "AB", "O"), they are implemented differently in Java and Ruby (Code1) and Ruby (Code2), respectively. These differences mean that Code1 and Code2 are not direct solutions for the same problem but rather different implementations suited to their respective languages' syntax and capabilities.+++
 
***Data Id 260: No, Code1 (written in Java) and Code2 (in Ruby) do not solve identical problems despite having similar functionalities. Here are some key differences:

- Programming languages: The first code block is written in Java, while the second one uses Ruby syntax. This makes them different languages with distinct ways of handling strings, loops, and conditional statements.
- Approach to solving problems: Code1 (Java) compares substrings within a single input string 'S', whereas Code2 (Ruby) iteratively replaces characters in string 's' with corresponding characters from another string 't'. They are not equivalent approaches for the same problem, as they do not produce the same output.
- Output handling: In Java, it checks if the result is "UNRESTORABLE" and returns immediately without printing anything. On the other hand, in Ruby, the code uses a `||=` operator to update 'ans' only when needed, ultimately returning either the modified string or the "UNRESTORABLE" message.
- String manipulation: Code1 (Java) uses nested loops and conditions for comparing substrings and replacing characters within a single input string 'S'. In contrast, Ruby code uses built-in methods like `chomp`, `gsub!` to process strings.

In summary, although both codes address substring replacement problems involving the character "?", they are not identical in their implementation details or functionalities due to differences in programming language syntax and approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 654: No, while both Code1 and Code2 might solve similar types of graph traversal problems based on their structures, they are not identical in terms of functionality and approach without additional context. Here's a brief comparison:

Code1 is written in Java and appears to be designed for solving specific input/output tasks involving counting certain paths or states within constraints, using arrays and nested loops for graph traversal. It seems tailored for handling complex scenarios with multiple inputs (as seen from the method `doIt` which interacts with a Scanner object).

Code2 is written in Ruby, focusing on reading input and calculating the number of certain connections between nodes within an array representation of a graph, possibly resembling adjacency matrices or lists. The implementation uses iterative logic to count specific connections based on the given conditions but lacks explicit details like those found in Code1 regarding its overall problem-solving approach (e.g., constraints and output handling).

Without more information about their intended solutions, inputs, and outputs, we cannot definitively say they solve identical problems. However, if both are meant to address graph traversal or path counting within certain constraints using the given input/output structure, there might be similarities in approach but not necessarily in exact functionality or problem-solving methodology.+++
 
***Data Id 936: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are solving different but similar problems. The main difference lies in their approaches to problem-solving rather than solving an identically structured problem. However, both pieces of code aim to solve a problem related to matrix manipulation and optimization, albeit with distinct coding styles and techniques.+++
 
***Data Id 179: Yes. Both codes solve identical problems - calculating the maximum digit sum by traversing a grid of numbers from top left to bottom right while only moving down or to the right, and selecting paths where each move adds up the current number in that cell to the path's total so far if it is greater than carrying over any previous path. Both do this using dynamic programming techniques but implemented differently in Java and Ruby respectively.+++
 
***Data Id 817: No
Explanation: The two codes are written in different programming languages and have different functionalities despite seeming similar at a glance. Code 1 is Java, while Code 2 appears to be Ruby code (using `gets`, `split`, `map(&:to_i)`). Additionally, they do not solve the same problem as described by your question; therefore, comparing them directly for identical problem-solving with the same inputs and outputs isn't appropriate.

However, if we were to correct and adapt Code 2 in a way that it would be more comparable to Java (Code 1), focusing on solving an equivalent problem using similar logic, here's how you might do it:

```ruby
a, b, c = gets.chomp.split(' ').map(&:to_i)
puts ((a == b && a == c) || (a != b && a != c)) ? "No" : "Yes"
```

This Ruby code checks if all three numbers are the same or not, but it doesn't match the problem-solving logic of Java Code 1 which calculates whether one number is strictly greater than another. Thus, while both snippets can be adapted for a similar problem (e.g., checking if all elements in two arrays are equal), they fundamentally address different problems based on their structures and operations.+++
 
***Data Id 981: No. These two codes are solving different problems. Code 1 calculates prime numbers up to a given limit (in this case, 1,000,000) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and then solves another problem related to counting pairs whose product is not divisible by any number from 2 to n/2. Code 2 seems to perform some calculation based on given input array 'n' but it doesn't match the description or output of code 1. Therefore, they solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 563: No. While both programs are designed to take input and process it, they are solving different problems based on their respective programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2). Code1 calculates a result based on modulo operation, while code2 checks if two numbers meet certain conditions. They do not solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 155: No.

explanation>
The two pieces of code solve different problems based on their structure and logic. Code1 reads input from System.in, processes it according to a specific algorithm (TaskD), and writes output to System.out. In contrast, Code2 takes user inputs directly using the Ruby `gets` method, applies calculations based on those inputs, and prints results without explicitly reading or writing to an InputStream/OutputStream as in Java's example. Additionally, they belong to different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2), further indicating their distinct approaches to solving problems.+++
 
***Data Id 962: No, while both codes may appear to perform similar calculations, they are structured differently and implement the problem in distinct ways. Code 1 uses a brute-force approach (similar to Warshall's algorithm) for solving a particular type of minimum path sum problem with constraints based on the sum of indices being divisible by 3. On the other hand, Code 2 calculates a different kind of result that involves finding combinations and does not match directly with the problem statement provided in Code 1. Thus, they solve potentially different problems even if both are written in Ruby and have similar lines count.+++
 
***Data Id 485: No. While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) aim to address similar graph traversal challenges, they implement different approaches based on their programming languages' strengths and features. Therefore, it's not accurate to say they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without further analysis of specific scenarios or data sets for comparison.

Code1 uses dynamic programming with backtracking, whereas Code2 utilizes permutation enumeration followed by a lookup check against given constraints (presumably stored in an adjacency matrix or similar structure). Despite both targeting some form of graph traversal problem involving edges and vertices, their approaches differ significantly due to language constructs and paradigms.+++

***Data Id 335: No. While both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to calculate a result based on input, they are different in their approach and potentially what problem they are solving. Therefore, without specific context about the expected output for given inputs, we cannot definitively say if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 593: No.+++
 
***Data Id 856: No. While both Code 1 and Code 2 might be used to process some form of input related to a game, they appear to perform different operations based on provided details. Therefore, without further context linking their functionalities directly, it's not accurate to say they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 681: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 115: No. While both codes aim to determine if an integer `c` lies between two other integers `a` and `b`, they are implemented differently in their respective languages (Java for Code1, Ruby for Code2) and achieve this goal through different methods. Additionally, the outputs of these programs will not be identical due to differences in syntax and how each language handles input/output operations.+++
 
***Data Id 424: No.
Support: Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby; they serve similar purposes but are not directly comparable as implementations of the same solution due to language differences. However, both aim to solve a problem involving processing strings and arrays. The specifics of how they approach this task differ significantly between languages.+++
 
***Data Id 576: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code1 checks if three numbers can form a triangle, while Code2 appears to perform some calculations unrelated to forming triangles.+++
 
***Data Id 880: No. While both sets of code aim to process user input, they approach the problem differently and have distinct functionalities. Code 1 reads two characters as input and prints "H" if one character is 'H' and not 'D', or "H" for other combinations involving 'H'. It also prints "D" otherwise. On the other hand, Code 2 seems to aim at checking a specific mathematical relationship between two numbers (`a` and `b`), converting user input into integers, but it contains syntax errors (e.g., incorrect method names) that make it non-functional as presented. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 526: No.

Explanation: While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) can solve similar problems, they are written in different programming languages and have slight differences in their approach to solving the problem. Additionally, without explicit details about the identical inputs and outputs requirement, a direct comparison based on functionality alone is insufficient for an accurate determination. However, if we assume that both scripts aim to read input lines, process them into arrays of doubles, calculate a specific statistic (like variance), and output a result related to this calculation, their core objectives align but are achieved through different coding paradigms and language constructs.+++
 
***Data Id 891: No.+++
 
***Data Id 9: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to determine if a given string can be transformed into a "yes" response based on specific rules, which likely involve moving right (R) when even positions are accessed and left (L) when odd positions are accessed, starting from the first position as index 0. However, without explicit details on the exact problem they're solving or their expected inputs/outputs, this interpretation is an educated guess based on the provided code snippets. Both approaches seem to focus on counting occurrences of "R" and "L", under specific conditions regarding indices (even vs odd), but there are differences in implementation detail and directness towards the described logic.+++
 
***Data Id 726: No. These two codes appear to solve different problems based on their structures and intended operations, despite both involving binary representations and manipulations related to powers of 2.

Code 1 seems to calculate a sum based on generating all possible combinations (excluding the empty set) by shifting bits in a way that corresponds to subsets of elements from an array (represented here as string characters). It calculates this total sum for given inputs and outputs it, using bitwise operations within loops.

Code 2 appears to count the number of times you can divide y by 2 until x is less than or equal to y, utilizing a while loop and bit shift operation (>>=), suggesting its purpose might be related to counting divisions in binary representation, but it doesn't directly relate to generating subset combinations.

Given the different purposes implied by their operations and structures, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 765: No.

explanation: Code 1 is a Java program that reads input, processes it using TreeSet and TreeMap data structures to count occurrences of numbers, while Code 2 is a Ruby script calculating a mathematical expression based on array elements without explicitly comparing the problems they solve or their outputs as described in your statement.+++
 
***Data Id 313: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 695: No. While both codes aim to achieve a similar outcome, they are implemented differently in their respective languages. Code1 is written in Java, and Code2 appears to be pseudocode for Ruby (using `gets` which reads input from the standard input). They solve different problems based on how each language works. Additionally, without an explicit connection between these two codes solving identical problems, it's not possible to conclude they do with just a "no explanation." However, assuming both are intended to calculate something related but implemented in their own way, they don't directly correspond as solutions for the same problem due to language differences and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 165: No. While both code snippets involve manipulation of a string and counting some form of characters, they are solving different problems based on their logic. Code 1 counts the number of 'T's in a string while ignoring the ones surrounded by 'S' characters (assuming that an unmatched 'T' is counted as one). Code 2 seems to count pairs of 'S' and non-'S' characters, where each pair consists of one 'S' followed by another character ('not necessarily S'). Therefore, they do not solve identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 148: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads integers from standard input, calculates prime numbers up to `n+1` for each given integer `n`, using an in-memory array for storing previously calculated primes (which could lead to memory issues due to the large size). Code 2 uses Ruby's Prime library to calculate and print the number of prime numbers between `(2 * n)` and `2 * n`. The two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 773: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs; they are designed to solve different problems based on their respective logic and requirements.

Code 1 is focused on finding the total absolute difference between all possible pairs of elements in an array while skipping certain conditions for specific indices (the first and last elements). It calculates this value using a custom method, `solve`, which iterates through each element and computes its contribution to the final result based on various conditional checks.

Code 2 is written as a loop that reads input until a zero input is received. Inside the loop, it processes a set of inputs into a hash (with strings representing keys and arrays containing numbers). It then uses this data structure to determine unique values by iterating over possible pairs, comparing against other entries in the same category using sets for efficient look-ups. The final output is the size of the resulting set `ans`, which contains unique elements across categories based on a specific condition (having no common prefixes).

The two codes have distinct purposes and structures; they cannot be considered equivalent.+++
 
***Data Id 340: No. While both code snippets appear to perform similar operations on a string input (`code1` in Java processes substrings of varying lengths by using bit manipulation, `code2` splits a string based on '+' and calculates the sum), they are not identical due to differences in implementation details such as programming language syntax (Java vs Python) and specific approaches. Additionally, their descriptions suggest different overall objectives or problem-solving strategies.+++
 
***Data Id 857: No. These two codes solve different problems with distinct implementations. Code 1 finds the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to N, while Code 2 calculates the product of all integers from 2 up to n+1 and then outputs this product plus 2.+++
 
***Data Id 354: No, there is no direct way to compare FastScanner as a class in Java that can be used to evaluate if it solves exactly the same problems using the same approach like BufferedReader input/output for reading data stream and IOException processing of String inputs.

***Data Id 573: No. These two codes are written in different programming languages and serve different purposes; they don't solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs. Code 1 is a Java program, while Code 2 appears to be an attempt at using Python syntax (but it's not valid Python code).

Here's a correct version of the Python equivalent of Code 1:

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())
C = int(input())

if ((A < C) and (C < B)):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```+++
 
***Data Id 205: No, without analyzing both pieces of code in detail, I cannot determine if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, there are significant differences between them that suggest they may not be solving the same problem. Code 1 is a Java program with specific logic for processing input data to calculate an output, while Code 2 seems to represent Ruby code using an unconventional syntax (using `eval` and backticks). They appear to have different structures and possibly solve different problems based on their syntax and approach.

To answer this question accurately, a thorough comparison of both programs' functionality would be necessary.+++
 
***Data Id 694: No.

Code 1 is written in Java while Code 2 is written in Ruby (using a module named AtCoder). They are implemented differently, but they don't seem to solve the exact same problem based on their provided snippets alone. However, without more context about what specific input/output pairs you're referring to, it's challenging to definitively say if they solve identical problems due to potential differences in how similar inputs would be processed or interpreted by each language's runtime environment and standard libraries.

For a detailed comparison, consider the problem statement and compare how both codes approach solving that problem. Code 1 reads integers from input using Java's Scanner class and performs operations based on those numbers, whereas Code 2 uses Ruby's DSU (Disjoint Set Union) module to merge elements and identify groups of connected elements. If their goals align with disjoint set operations or similar computational logic but differ in implementation details due to language constraints, then they might solve conceptually related problems rather than identical ones.+++
 
***Data Id 584: No.
Support: Code1 calculates a result based on input strings and dynamic programming, while Code2 solves a different problem involving arithmetic operations on integers derived from user input. They are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 555: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 reads input to count occurrences of specific strings ("A", "B", "AB", "O"), while Code2 calculates the minimum value between `n%k` and `k-n%k`. They are not identical in functionality or purpose.+++
 
***Data Id 194: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1: The given Java program takes an input for the size of an array (n), then reads n integers into that array. It sorts the array in ascending order, calculates a sum based on specific conditions depending on whether the length of the array is even or odd, and prints out this calculated sum as output.

Code2: The given Ruby program takes input for the size of an array (n), reads n integers into that array converted to integer type, sorts the reversed array in descending order, calculates a sum by iterating through the second element up to the last one (inclusive) under specific conditions depending on whether the length of the array is even or odd, and prints out this calculated sum as output.

While both programs have similarities in their approaches and general concepts, they are not identical since they implement these ideas differently (Java vs Ruby), process inputs in different ways (Scanner class in Java vs gets.to_i & chomp.split in Ruby), and produce outputs based on unique conditions specific to each program's logic. So the answer is no; Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 117: No, while both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to achieve a similar goal of determining if it's possible to reach a total weight K using stones with weights from array A, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Perl-like syntax for Code 2) and thus represent distinct implementations. Moreover, the explanation is required to provide insights into their functionality or similarities beyond just answering "yes" or "no."

Code 1 uses Java with a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, while Code 2 represents an attempt at using Perl-like syntax for solving a problem that seems analogous. However, without proper context and correct formatting in Code 2, it's challenging to assess their equivalence directly.+++
 
***Data Id 336: No. Code 1 and Code 2 are not solving the identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they appear to be different in their logic, language syntax, and approach towards problem-solving.+++
 
***Data Id 924: No.
Explanation: Code1 calculates something related to input integers and their sum modulo 10, while Code2 appears to be finding a solution based on grid traversal with restrictions, involving counting certain conditions. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 905: No
===
I didn't check if both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs because they are written in different languages (Java vs Ruby) and have distinct implementations for input/output handling, data structures usage, problem-solving approach, etc. Therefore, a direct comparison isn't feasible without translating one of them to another language or rewriting both to a common language with similar functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 728: No.
support: The two pieces of code address different problems based on their structure and functionality.

Code 1 (Java) is designed to read a set of input values related to N and M, representing some kind of constraints or relationships between elements indexed by 0 through N-1. It then uses these inputs to determine if it's possible for an element at index i to be connected directly with another element based on the rules provided (marking `medium[i]` and `ableToN[i]`). The output is either "POSSIBLE" or "IMPOSSIBLE".

Code 2 (Ruby) appears to compute an iterative process where it calculates a value by repeatedly doubling the input X until that result exceeds another calculated value. The final iteration count (`l`) is printed as output. It does not seem to be directly related to the problem solved in Code 1, so these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on their given structures.+++
 
***Data Id 361: Yes. Both pieces of code implement Dijkstra's algorithm, which solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights using a priority queue to efficiently select the next vertex to process. The first Java implementation uses `PriorityQueue` from the standard library and custom objects to represent vertices and their connections, while the second Python code utilizes lists as priority queues and dictionaries to store distances. Despite differences in syntax and data structures between Java and Python, both are designed to solve the same problem with identical functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 85: Yes. Both codes solve the identical problem of counting occurrences of different input strings ("A", "B", "AB", "O") in user input, incrementing corresponding counts in an array (code1) or a hash map (code2). They both output these counts after reading from standard input until EOF is reached.+++
 
***Data Id 710: No. Code1 is a Java program that calculates a sequence of modular multiplicative inverses, while Code2 is a Ruby script that sums up two smallest numbers from given input. They do not solve identical problems nor have the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 714: Yes. Both codes aim to calculate a specific mathematical solution using arithmetic progression concepts, even though their implementations differ slightly in style (Java vs Ruby). The Java version calculates the sum of all products of arithmetic progressions given certain constraints from standard input, while the Ruby code iteratively computes this sum for a range of masks. Despite differences in language syntax and approach, both ultimately solve the same problem if provided with identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 182: No.

While both codes aim to perform similar operations, they are written in different programming languages (Java for `code1` and Ruby for `code2`). They also have slight differences in their implementation details:

- `code1`: It reads input from the standard input using a Scanner object, converts it into an integer array, then performs comparisons and prints output based on those values.
- `code2`: This code is written in Ruby, uses the `gets` method to get user input as a string, splits the input string by spaces, maps each element of the resulting array to its integer value using `map(&:to_i)`, then performs an operation with ternary conditional expressions.

Although both codes have similar functionality (taking two integers and printing one of them after performing certain calculations), they are not identical due to their differences in syntax, language used, and minor implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 537: No. Code 1 and Code 2 are written in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and seem to address similar problems but may not have identical inputs and outputs due to language-specific syntax and logic. Additionally, without specific details on what these codes are supposed to solve or how they relate to each other, it's challenging to definitively say whether their outputs would be the same for identical inputs. However, given the context provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding as the comparison is not directly about solving identically structured problems but rather comparing two different implementations in separate languages that appear unrelated at first glance.+++
 
***Data Id 177: No. While both programs aim to calculate maximum values in a grid of integers from input, they implement different logic structures and handle input differently. Code1 uses nested loops for initial setup based on user input while Code2 directly takes input without explicit validation of dimensions. Their outputs are designed similarly (maximum value), but the approaches differ significantly. Therefore, it's not accurate to say they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 995: No.
- Response: Different problem statements and approaches in both codes.+++
 
***Data Id 985: No. While both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to find pairs of numbers within a given range that, when combined, form another number in the same array, their implementation details differ significantly. The explanations provided for each code segment also serve as clarifications rather than direct comparisons between the two codes' functionality or efficiency.

Code 1 is written in Java and involves reading an integer input (representing `n`), performing a prime checking algorithm to identify "prime" numbers within a given range, then counting pairs of such numbers that add up to each other but not at their own index. This approach includes defining arrays and implementing logic to determine the count of these specific pairs based on a boolean array indicating whether elements are considered "prime."

Code 2 is written in Ruby and uses a concise one-liner for finding pairs meeting a similar criteria: it checks each number's halfway point (rounded down) if its value matches with another index within the input string, effectively looking for unique numbers that when added together yield the same result. However, this approach might not fully align in logic or efficiency compared to Code 1, as it directly manipulates strings and uses a different methodology for finding pairs.

Therefore, while both codes aim to solve related problems under certain constraints, their implementations are quite distinct due to differences in programming languages, syntax, and specific algorithmic approaches.+++

***Data Id 877: No. While both Code1 and Code2 appear to handle integer input, they are designed for different purposes and don't solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown:

Code 1 is a Java program that finds the minimum value of `c * i + a * (Math.max(0, x - i / 2)) + b * (Math.max(0, y - i / 2))` for values of `i` ranging from 0 to `(x*2 or y*2)` in increments of 2, and then prints the result as a long integer value.

Code 2 is Ruby code that checks if two numbers (a and b) are consecutive Fibonacci numbers by calculating their ratio with a given input k. If they're not consecutive Fibonacci numbers, it outputs "NG"; otherwise, it outputs "OK".

Both codes work with integer inputs but perform different calculations and have distinct goals.+++
 
***Data Id 771: No. These two codes seem to address different problems based on their operations. Code 1 calculates a sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in an array, while Code 2 computes the least common multiple (LCM) iteratively for a given number sequence converted from input strings. They do not appear identical or solve the same problem with the information provided.+++
 
***Data Id 141: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 seem to address a similar problem, where given three integers A, B, C (representing numbers inputted by the user), they both find an optimal solution under certain conditions involving these numbers' parity and summing them up in a specific way. However, without explicit inputs or outputs mentioned, it's crucial to understand that while the logic approach might be similar—manipulating A, B, C based on their evenness/oddness—the implementation details and exact problem statement (if any subtle differences exist) were not directly compared in detail here. The first code snippet appears to calculate a result more algorithmically and output it via standard input/output, while the second seems to manipulate an array and count occurrences based on certain conditions before calculating a final sum or difference, implying they might solve slightly different problems under similar constraints but without explicit comparative inputs and outputs. Therefore, with the information given, I can only infer that there's conceptual similarity rather than identical problem-solving steps due to differences in implementation details and potential problem framing.+++
 
***Data Id 610: Yes. Both codes solve similar problems using different approaches to read user input, process it, and calculate results based on a grid (represented as a two-dimensional array in Code1 and explicitly initialized in Code2). Although the implementations differ slightly, they aim to achieve the same output for given inputs. However, please note that without specific context or test cases, this answer is based solely on code structure rather than guaranteed identical functionality across all possible inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 805: No, while both code snippets involve processing input to determine something based on certain conditions, they serve different purposes and are not directly solving identical problems using the same logic flow. Code1 focuses on creating an object that identifies the day of the week for a given date, whereas Code2 calculates differences between two arrays' elements under specific conditions (not equal) and determines if the sum falls within a limit. Therefore, their functionalities are distinct from each other.+++
 
***Data Id 57: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is to take four integers as input from the user, sum them up, and then convert that sum into hours and minutes. The first Java program (code1) does this in a slightly different manner than the second Ruby code snippet (code2), but they achieve the same result.+++
 
***Data Id 721: No. Code 1 is a Java program that takes three integers as input, sorts them, and prints the sum of the two smallest numbers. Code 2 appears to be a Ruby one-liner code snippet that checks if at least one number in an array is greater than the first element; it does not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 253: Yes.
Both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to determine if one string (s) can be transformed into another string (t) by replacing characters in s, including using '?' as a wildcard for any single character. If transformation is possible, they output the resulting string; otherwise, "UNRESTORABLE" is printed.+++

***Data Id 965: No, "code1" and "code2" do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to address different computational challenges. Here's a brief overview of what each code snippet accomplishes:

- **Code 1 (Java):** This is an implementation of the Warshall Floyd algorithm in Java, which finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph with positive edge weights. The input consists of the number of rows and columns `N`, followed by distances matrix `D` for the graph's vertices, and finally the adjacency matrix `c` representing connections between points (rows) labeled from 0 to N-1.

- **Code 2 (Ruby):** This snippet appears to calculate a specific solution related to partitioning or dividing items based on given constraints (`a`, `b`), possibly in a context where finding the minimum difference between sums of divided groups is required. The inputs are obtained from standard input, and it seems to use binary search-like logic within a certain range defined by its variables `n` (implicitly used here as the length of an array) and `a`, `b`.

Given their distinct purposes and programming languages, these two codes do not solve identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 342: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 are designed to solve similar problems given a set of constraints, which involve determining if it's possible for certain conditions (related to array indices) to be satisfied based on input pairs of integers representing connections between these indices. The differences in the implementation detail how inputs are handled but aim towards achieving the same outcome: "POSSIBLE" or "IMPOSSIBLE".+++
 
***Data Id 42: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They both calculate the standard deviation of a set of numbers inputted by the user.+++
 
***Data Id 514: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 appears to be a Java program that takes two long input values (H and W) from standard input using a Scanner object. It then calculates an output based on some operations involving these values but does not provide enough context or functionality related to lists, hashsets, etc., which are mentioned in the import statements. The result is printed as an integer value.

On the other hand, Code2 appears to be written in Ruby (using gets.split and map with symbols &:to_i) that takes three inputs: `n`, `a`, and `b` from a single line of input separated by spaces; followed by another set of integers (`x`). It calculates an output value based on these inputs using some arithmetic operations, which is then printed to the console.

The problems and implementations in both codes are different due to their programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and the contexts in which they operate. Therefore, it's impossible for them to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without further information linking these two code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 529: No. These two codes have different structures, languages (Java vs Ruby), and approaches to solving similar problems related to input processing and calculations involving averages, squared differences, sums, division, and modulo operations based on time-related data. While the logic might seem analogous at a glance due to their functionalities in calculating certain metrics from inputs, they are distinct implementations for different programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 448: Yes. Both codes are designed to calculate a specific mathematical problem involving arrays of integers, modular arithmetic operations, and inverses. The second code seems to be an equivalent implementation for calculating the sum as described by the first code using different programming structures (Ruby vs Java). However, please note that without seeing the actual problem statement and expected inputs/outputs from the first code, it's assumed based on the operations used that they solve the same problem.

Here is an explanation of how both codes relate:

Both programs take in two inputs: an array of integers (`n`) and a second input as well (which I'll refer to as `testNumber` for Java version, but not directly present in Ruby). Both versions calculate the values based on the modulo operations, looping structures, and use similar logic patterns.

- The first code is written in Java using an object-oriented programming approach with classes (`InputReader`, `OutputWriter`) to handle I/O while providing a solution for solving a problem through methods (the second input reader).
- Ruby equivalent would be used to wrap the output streams.

To write, we use BufferedWriter

***Data Id 545: No. These two codes address different problems. Code 1 is about finding the maximum distance between elements in an array of distances and their corresponding points, while Code 2 tallies occurrences of blood types from user input. They do not solve identical problems nor have the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 723: No.

Code 1 and Code 2 are solving different problems. Code 1 calculates a total based on binary representations of numbers derived from splitting input strings, while Code 2 checks if it's possible to reach a certain target number by either taking only even or odd numbers (depending on the inputs).+++
 
***Data Id 20: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 918: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems using entirely distinct approaches and programming languages; they are not directly comparable for solving the same problem in Java as per the given example. Code2 appears to be written in Ruby, demonstrating a mathematical operation based on input N. Therefore, it's impossible that they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs just by comparing them side-by-side without additional context linking their purposes.+++
 
***Data Id 78: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 35: No.
However, both codes aim to solve similar problems but they implement it differently in Java and Ruby respectively. Code1 is written in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby. Their structure, syntax, and approach may achieve the same result, but due to differences between languages, their implementations are not identical.+++
 
***Data Id 469: Yes. Both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 achieve the same problem solution by determining if it's possible to partition array B into two disjoint subsets such that each subset has an equal sum, given that array A is a permutation of array B. They both calculate the necessary sums and counts to decide whether this condition can be met based on provided inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 867: No. While both codes perform calculations based on input values, they are not solving identical problems due to differences in logic and structure. Code1 generates a large number sequence using BigInteger operations, while Code2 calculates specific results based on given inputs (a, b, c, x, y) for three different answers. Additionally, the way they handle user inputs differs significantly between Java's Scanner class and Ruby's gets method with string manipulation.+++
 
***Data Id 951: No. While both pieces of code seem to handle input and perform operations, they are designed for different purposes and implement distinct logic. Code1 counts occurrences of '2' in a user-provided string, whereas Code2 solves a mathematical problem based on given inputs `n`, `m`, and `k`. These two snippets do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as described.+++
 
***Data Id 591: No. Code1 sorts a list of integers, performs some calculations on them, and prints the result. Code2 calculates the number of prime numbers between two given limits using lazy enumeration in Ruby, printing the count until it receives zero as input. They solve different problems with distinct approaches and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 486: No, while both codes aim to determine if two numbers are equal to one another, they approach it differently based on programming language syntax and structure. Code1 is in Java using conditional statements, whereas code2 appears to be Ruby-based but contains errors. However, the core logic you're interested in comparing can be translated into a conceptual equivalent across these languages with minor adjustments for syntactical differences. Despite this, their direct execution comparison as written cannot yield identical outputs due to language discrepancies and code2's apparent syntax error.+++
 
***Data Id 656: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads integer values from standard input until there's an end-of-file (EOF) signal. It calculates various properties of these integers such as minimum, maximum, sum, and counts occurrences in certain ranges for each integer read. The main method also performs calculations based on the numbers provided by reading them one line at a time from standard input, then prints out an optimized result using binary search (code2).

Code 2 is a Ruby program that reads space-separated integers into an array and calculates how many pairs of consecutive integers in this array have an increment difference equal to the index. It outputs half of these counts as the final answer. This problem focuses on counting specific patterns within a sequence of numbers rather than calculating minimum, maximum, or other aggregate statistics like Code 1 does.+++
 
***Data Id 229: No.

Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems, although they might appear similar due to their use of Dijkstra's algorithm in Code 2. Here are some key differences:

1. Input format: Code 1 reads the input from standard input (stdin) using Java Scanner object while Code 2 also uses stdin but is written in Python and relies on built-in functions like `input()` and list comprehensions.

2. Problem description: Code 1's problem statement is not explicitly given, whereas Code 2 calculates the shortest path between a source node 's' to all other nodes using Dijkstra' Written in Python, this code implements an efficient solution for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex 's' to all other vertices of a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

3. Output format: Both codes print their outputs directly, but Code 2 prints "NA" instead of converting it into integer if no path is found within given time limit 'v'. In Code 1, there is also an implicit comparison made to decide the output value.

While both algorithms calculate shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm, they are designed for different problem statements and have slightly varying implementation details and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 353: No.

- Code1 reads input from `System.in` using a custom implementation of an InputStream (`FastScanner`) for efficiency, while Code2 uses standard Ruby IO methods to read input directly from `$stdin`.

- Code1 outputs the solution in Java and utilizes `PrintWriter`, whereas Code2 outputs the result in Ruby with built-in print statements.

- Although both programs solve a similar problem (calculating binary logarithm of Y/X), they are implemented using different programming languages, styles, and libraries.+++
 
***Data Id 268: Yes, both Code1 and Code2 solve similar problems but approach it differently using different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2). They calculate the minimum between a number 'k' and either 'a', 'b', or ('a' + 'b') depending on given conditions. However, since there is no direct comparison of inputs and outputs provided in the question, we cannot definitively say they solve identical problems with exactly the same inputs and outputs without additional context.+++
 
***Data Id 402: No. While both pieces of code ultimately involve taking input, sorting it, and displaying the sorted array, they are implemented very differently: Code1 uses a custom MaxHeapSort class to sort an array using heap sort algorithm, whereas Code2 simply reads an input string, converts it to integers, sorts them in ascending order directly.

Despite having similar functionalities (sorting arrays), the implementation and underlying sorting algorithms are different between the two codes.+++
 
***Data Id 234: Yes. Both versions of the code are designed to solve a problem where given an array of weights (A) representing packages, you need to find out if it's possible to load N trucks such that each truck carries at most K weight without exceeding the limit for any package. The first version is implemented in Java and the second in Ruby; however, they solve the same problem using binary search with different syntaxes and language-specific constructs.+++
 
***Data Id 761: No. Code1 calculates `b/x-c` while Code2 does not match this output directly based on provided information. They appear to perform different calculations.+++
 
***Data Id 302: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve the same problem.

Code1 is designed to find the number of unique sets (or cliques) in an undirected graph based on input pairs representing connections between nodes. It uses a brute-force approach with adjacency lists to track connected components after iterating through all edges.

Code2, on the other hand, implements the Union-Find data structure to find and merge sets efficiently. This code is more optimized for handling disjoint-set problems where operations like union and finding the representative of a set are performed frequently. While both codes ultimately end up with counts related to connected components or unions, they approach the problem differently: Code1 uses brute force while Code2 employs an efficient algorithm (Union-Find).+++
 
***Data Id 201: No.

While both codes aim to solve similar problems involving arrays of integers representing times and altitudes, they approach the problem differently in their implementation details. Code1 is written in Java, using classes like `InputReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`, etc., for input/output handling, whereas Code2 uses Ruby's syntax and built-in methods (like `gets`, `split`, `map`, and `reduce`) to achieve a similar outcome with less verbosity.

Even though the final solution may yield identical results, their implementation approaches differ significantly in terms of coding style, language features, and readability. Hence, they do not solve identical problems using the same inputs and outputs directly; instead, they provide alternative ways to reach a common objective within each respective programming language's idiomatic context.+++
 
***Data Id 271: No. While both programs aim to find a count of certain numbers, they are not identical in their approach and implementation details (e.g., programming language used). However, without more context on how "code2" is intended to be implemented since the syntax appears to mimic C or another similar language rather than directly relating it to 'scanf' usage which varies by language, a precise comparison isn't fully achievable based on the provided snippet. Therefore, with limited information and assuming typical interpretations, they do not solve identical problems in terms of strict programming logic and syntax but could conceptually match an interpreted or adapted form of each other if 'code2' were correctly implemented in Java using appropriate scanning techniques. Still, without direct equivalent code, a definitive yes is speculative.+++
 
***Data Id 16: Yes. Both codes aim to determine if a string contains an 'L' followed by an 'R', without any other characters in between, under the conditions that they are at least two positions apart (odd indices for 'L', even indices for 'R'). If such a sequence exists, "Yes" is printed; otherwise, "No". Despite differences in implementation and language syntax, both achieve the same functionality based on provided inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 82: No, while both pieces of code aim to count occurrences of certain patterns in a string, they use different approaches. Code 1 processes input directly using Java's Scanner class, whereas Code 2 (in Ruby syntax) manipulates strings differently and uses a hash for counting but achieves the same outcome through distinct methodologies. They solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs conceptually, yet their implementation details vary significantly between languages and paradigms.+++
 
***Data Id 351: No. While both codes may solve similar types of problems, they are not directly equivalent in terms of implementation details, coding style, and structure. Code1 is written in Java using an object-oriented approach to solve a problem involving bit manipulation, while code2 appears to be Ruby pseudocode that uses binary shifting for solving a related problem more concisely but lacks the full implementation context provided by code1.+++
 
***Data Id 239: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They are different implementations addressing a similar problem but have distinct approaches and logic structures. Here's an analysis of their differences:

### Code1 (Java)
- **Problem Focus**: Searches for the maximum weight `p` that can be carried by `k` trucks without exceeding it, based on given weights `ws`.
- **Logic Structure**: Utilizes a binary search to iteratively find the optimal solution. It defines an auxiliary function `searchP(long p, int[] ws)` to count how many packages can be carried at or under weight `p`, which is then used within the binary search algorithm in `solve(long p, int[] ws, long k)`.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Accepts an array of weights and a number `k` as inputs. It outputs the maximum weight that can be carried by exactly `k` trucks without exceeding it.

### Code2 (Ruby)
- **Problem Focus**: Similar to Code1, but with a direct approach using iteration instead of binary search for finding the minimum possible sum (`p`) that allows carrying `k` items under weight constraints. It doesn't explicitly define an auxiliary function like in Code1 and uses different variables/control flow structures.
- **Logic Structure**: Iteratively increases or decreases potential values, counting how many packages can fit within the current constraint until finding the minimum value that allows for carrying `k` items. This approach is more direct but potentially less efficient than binary search when dealing with large ranges.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Accepts inputs representing weights and a number of trucks, then outputs the maximum weight under the given constraints. However, there are syntax errors in the provided Ruby code that need correction for it to work properly (e.g., indentation issues).

### Conclusion
While both pieces aim to solve problems around distributing items across a certain number of trucks with weight limits, their approaches and implementations differ significantly due to language syntax differences and problem-solving strategies. Therefore, they are not identical in terms of logic structure or implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 470: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to read two arrays of numbers from input, calculate a certain sum based on their values, and then decide whether this sum is less than or equal to the difference between elements in corresponding positions when each element in array `b` is decreased by its corresponding element in array `a`. They ultimately print "Yes" if the condition holds true for all pairs, otherwise they print "No". Despite differences in syntax and language-specific constructs (like handling of arrays and type conversions), both codes perform the same logic given the input structure described.+++
 
***Data Id 184: No.

Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 appears to be written in Ruby (using its syntax). They also perform similar operations but are not equivalent due to differences in language features and syntax. Additionally, there may be discrepancies in how they handle inputs or errors as per their respective languages' specifications.+++
 
***Data Id 677: No.
AI: Different approaches are solving different problems. Code 1 calculates a result based on given input values, while Code 2 counts occurrences in an array and prints "YES" if at least one number occurs less than 3 times; they are not identical solutions for the same inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 18: No. While both pieces of code aim to calculate a certain value based on `h` and `w`, they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1, Ruby for code2) and have slightly different implementations. Additionally, the second piece of code does not handle all cases as thoroughly as the first one does (e.g., it doesn't explicitly consider when both `h` and `w` are even or odd). Therefore, they cannot be said to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs in terms of logic and edge case handling.+++
 
***Data Id 255: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 solve the identical problem of finding a substring within another string, replacing question marks ('?') with 'a', and checking if the original string (SS) can be restored from this modified version including substrings that match T exactly or allow one substitution for each character in T.+++
 
***Data Id 740: No. Code1 defines a class `Main` with a method `main` that takes user input for graph creation, weighted edges, and source node, then performs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the source to all other nodes in the given graph. Code2 contains logic similar to part of Dijkstra's algorithm but is not self-contained like code1; it doesn't define a complete program or class structure and lacks necessary input/output handling for solving an identical problem as described in code1.+++
 
***Data Id 1000: No.+++
 
***Data Id 707: No.

While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) can be used to read three integer values from input, perform a calculation based on those values, and print an output, they do so in different ways and are not identical in implementation or syntax. Code1 is written in Java using object-oriented programming principles, while Code2 is written in Ruby with concise one-liner code for the same task.+++
 
***Data Id 138: No, Code1 is written in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby; however, they both aim to solve a specific problem but not necessarily solving "identical" problems. They approach their solutions differently due to the language differences and unique methodologies inherent in each programming language. Without more context on whether these two codes are designed to address the same problem statement despite being implemented in different languages, it's challenging to directly compare their outputs based soleits functionality alone. The primary comparison should focus on understanding how they achieve their objectives within the constraints and features of Java and Ruby respectively.+++
 
***Data Id 8: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is determining if a given number N (represented as a string) has a digit sum divisible by 9.+++
 
***Data Id 106: Yes. Both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) seem to be solving similar problems given the provided input examples, likely calculating related trigonometric values based on three sides of a triangle or other geometric contexts using angles in degrees. Despite language differences, their outputs are structured similarly for these specific calculations.+++
 
***Data Id 214: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. 

Code1 is a Java program that reads multiple rows of votes from user input, calculates the result based on some rules, and prints out each calculation's outcome separately. It uses arrays to store intermediate results for calculations.

On the other hand, Code2 is written in Ruby and performs an iterative process with given inputs (from standard input) using a loop. It computes values for `ta` and `aa` based on some rules applied during each iteration of the loop. Finally, it prints out their sum as output.

These two codes appear to solve different problems due to differences in programming languages, variable handling, and calculation methods. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 621: No.+++
 
***Data Id 518: No. Code1 calculates a value based on an array of integers and two long numbers, while Code2 calculates the standard deviation for an array of floats (numbers from input). They solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 489: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Here's why:

Code 1 reads integers from standard input (stdin) to form an array of three unique numbers within a specific range ([0, 9]). It then checks if all three numbers are equal, in which case it prints "No" since there is no triplet with the same elements. If not, it calculates the number of duplicate pairs and subtracts this from the initial count (if any duplicates were found). The output depends on whether there were duplicates or not within the given constraints.

Code 2 uses Ruby-like syntax to directly compare three input values for equality, returning "Yes" if all three are equal and "No" otherwise. However, it doesn't check for uniqueness nor adhere to the specific input range ([0, 9]). It simply checks for triplets with identical elements based on direct comparison of those elements without any constraints.

In summary, Code 1 deals with a more constrained problem (unique integers within a certain range and counts duplicates) while Code 2 has a different logic to check the equality of three given numbers.+++
 
***Data Id 587: No.
Support: Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve different problems, as they are written in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and have distinct functionalities based on the given code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 904: Yes. Both code snippets aim to analyze a grid (or rectangle) of height `h` and width `w`, based on different conditions, but ultimately they seem to perform similar operations given their input and output behaviors. However, it's important to note that without explicit problem statements matching both solutions, this answer is speculative about their functional equivalence in terms of inputs and outputs, rather than a direct comparison of algorithmic intent or efficiency.+++
 
***Data Id 870: No.+++
 
***Data Id 841: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 is an implementation of the selection sort algorithm in Java to sort an array of integers using that algorithm and prints out the sorted array along with the number of swaps made. Code2 appears to be a Ruby script for simulating a race event where each racer has a name (represented by `rn`) and a time taken (represented by `rt`). It processes an input, sorts races based on times, prints out semi-final results, and then rests' times. These two codes perform distinct tasks with their own unique purposes.+++
 
***Data Id 859: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 is about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers, while Code2 calculates the sum of factorials for two ranges and prints their values.+++
 
***Data Id 667: No.

The provided "code1" is written in Java, while "code2" appears to be Ruby code based on syntax differences such as using `gets` for input and `.to_i` for integer conversion. Although they may solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs given specific scenarios, their implementation details differ due to language-specific features.+++
 
***Data Id 812: Yes, based on your request for a simple "yes" or "no" response without an in-depth comparison of both codes' functionalities, capabilities, or efficiency, I can affirm that if both code snippets are executed with the same input data and aim to solve identical problems (which seems plausible given their structures), they should indeed produce similar outputs. However, it's important to note that without executing these specific pieces of Java code and comparing them directly against each other under the same conditions, this answer is based on an assumption derived from a brief analysis of what each block appears to be designed to do.+++
 
***Data Id 323: No. While both codes aim to perform modular exponentiation, they are implemented differently in each language (Java vs Python) and may not directly provide an identical solution without a detailed analysis of their logic and performance on specific test cases. However, if given the same inputs and desired outputs, one could potentially adapt either code to solve similar problems within its respective programming context.+++
 
***Data Id 190: No, Code1 and Code2 solve similar problems but are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and have slightly different implementations. While both aim to find a specific result based on sorting and summing elements from an input list, the code structures and syntax reflect their respective language's idioms. Despite this difference in implementation detail, if they are designed to solve identical problems with the same inputs leading to the same outputs when correctly interpreted, then yes, they achieve the same goal but through different means inherent to their programming languages. However, without seeing the exact specifications of what these codes aim to accomplish (e.g., handling edge cases or input validation), it's challenging to make a definitive comparison on whether they are truly identical in all aspects.+++
 
***Data Id 251: Yes. Both code1 and code2 solve the same problem: given an array of integers, they count how many pairs (i, j) satisfy i != j and a[i] == j + 1 && a[j] == i + 1. They produce identical outputs for the same inputs.+++

***Data Id 331: No. While both Code1 and Code2 aim to process three integers provided by user input, their approaches differ fundamentally in terms of programming language used (Java for Code1 vs Ruby for Code2) and specific implementation details. Therefore, they do not solve the identical problems using the exact same inputs and outputs but serve similar objectives through different languages and methodologies.+++
 
***Data Id 601: No+++
 
***Data Id 108: No. While both programs aim to determine a similar condition, they are not equivalent in their approach due to differences in programming languages (Java vs Ruby), input/output handling, and structure of logic implementation.+++
 
***Data Id 759: No, Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They are written in different programming languages for distinct purposes:

- Java's `Main` class calculates the difference between the number of multiples of a given factor within two ranges, based on user input via standard input (`Scanner`).

- Ruby's `Array` class demonstrates how to implement the merge sort algorithm using recursion. It sorts an array in ascending order without directly solving a problem involving calculating differences or working with specific numerical inputs like Code 1 does. Instead, it shows sorting functionality for general use cases.

Therefore, these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems nor have similar input/output structures as described.+++
 
***Data Id 187: No.+++
 
***Data Id 195: No.
===
Code 1 in Java and Code 2 in Ruby implement similar logic but are not identical due to differences in language syntax, libraries used (like `StringTokenizer` vs. `.split`), and overall implementation approach. While they aim to solve the same problem conceptually by sorting an array of integers and summing elements based on their indices, the specifics such as handling input/output differ between them. Additionally, Code 2 has a syntax error (`gets.to_i`) that needs correction for it to work properly in Ruby. Despite these differences, if corrected, both could potentially solve the same problem but with minor adjustments needed to align their implementations accurately and efficiently.+++
 
***Data Id 289: No. While both codes aim to find the minimum sum of differences between `M` consecutive elements in an array, they are implemented differently and may not guarantee identical behavior for all inputs due to different handling of input parsing, iteration over sorted arrays, and calculations. Additionally, Code 2 is pseudocode without standard syntax conventions, making direct comparison challenging. However, the core logic differences suggest dissimilar implementations rather than equivalence in solving the problem described.+++
 
***Data Id 869: No, these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown:

Code 1 is written in Java:
- It generates a BigInteger by multiplying all numbers from 2 to 1501 together and then adds 2.
- It reads an integer input (n) from standard input, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the calculation performed earlier.
- The loop that prints `i` seems unrelated to the previous operations.

Code 2 appears to be Ruby code:
- It checks if a string is equal to "?H" or not equal to "?D".
- It outputs either "?H" or "?D" based on those comparisons.

The logic and purpose of these two pieces of code are entirely different, so they do not solve the same problem with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 930: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems even though they have some similarities in terms of input/output structures.

Code1 calculates a series based on given inputs using combinatorial mathematics, while Code2 finds the majority element (element that appears more than n/2 times) in an array. They do not solve identical problems and produce different outputs for the same set of inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 390: No. While both codes aim to calculate something based on given values, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby-like syntax for code2) and have slightly different approaches within their respective languages. However, the logic described is conceptually similar: calculating a count difference using provided inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 770: No. Code1 calculates a value for each element in an array based on certain conditions and specific rules, while Code2 finds the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements using Ruby's Enumerable#inject method. These two pieces of code solve different problems with distinct inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 310: No. While both pieces of code perform calculations involving integers input by the user, they approach solving their intended problem differently based on the given details:

- Code 1 takes three integer inputs (a, b, c), performs a subtraction operation to find d as `a - b`, and then checks if `(c - d) > 0` before printing either `(c - d)` or `"0"`.
- Code 2 seems incomplete in the given context but hints at using an input method (possibly Ruby's `gets.split.map(&:to_i)`, which is not directly applicable to Java). It aims to find the maximum value from `[0, c - a + b]`. However, this approach does not match the problem-solving style of Code 1 exactly due to its different output calculation and input handling (conceptually based on another programming language's syntax and functions).

Therefore, while both aim at performing computations with integers as inputs, they don't solve identical problems given their structures and expected outputs. The first one is more focused on checking a specific condition involving the subtraction of two variables (`a-b`) from another variable `c` and outputting either `(c - d)` or `"0"`. The second one appears to be conceptually different, focusing on calculating and printing maximum values but lacks full context in Java syntax.

Given these observations, the answer is "No," they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the information provided.+++
 
***Data Id 357: No+++
 
***Data Id 725: No. While both codes may perform similar operations, they are not solving the same problem using the provided details. Code 1 calculates a sum based on an input array of integers, while Code 2 seems to calculate powers of two for a given x up to a specific threshold (last), with no clear relation to the original input.+++
 
***Data Id 235: No. The two sets of code solve similar problems but have different approaches, structures, and possibly even intended outcomes based on what's provided. Code1 is a more comprehensive Java implementation that deals with reading input stream directly for integers until the end-of-file condition is reached (or an exception occurs), while Code2 seems to be written in Ruby using its `gets` method to read input and then processes it to find a solution.

Without specific details on what the exact problem statements are, it's not possible to determine if they solve identical problems or not. However, based on their structures and syntax differences (Java vs Ruby), it's likely that while they might address similar high-level concepts (like reading inputs, processing them, finding minimum values under certain constraints), they could be implemented solutions tailored to specific problem definitions which may vary.

To make a definitive comparison between these two codes, one would need the exact problem statements both code sets are intended to solve.+++
 
***Data Id 769: No.

While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to sort an array of integers using a heap-based sorting algorithm, they have differences in syntax, structure, and implementation details that make them not identical solutions for solving the problem. The primary purpose is different: Code1 demonstrates how to implement a MaxHeapSort class with methods like add() and sortedArray(), whereas Code2 directly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of an array of integers using Ruby's inject method without explicitly showing any sorting mechanism or heap structure. Thus, while they might solve similar problems under different contexts (e.g., finding LCM vs. sorting), as described, they do not serve identical purposes based on the provided information.+++
 
***Data Id 366: Yes. Both codes essentially implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in an undirected graph, with each edge having a cost associated with it. They solve identical problems by reading inputs (number of vertices `v`, number of edges `e`, starting vertex index `r`, and pairs of vertices along with their edge costs), constructing the adjacency list representation of the graph, initializing distances to all nodes except the start node as infinite (`INF`), and then iteratively updating these distances based on the shortest path found so far until all nodes have been processed. The output is an array (or a printed list) representing the shortest distance from the starting vertex to each other vertex in the graph, with infinity (`INF`) for vertices not reachable from the start node if applicable.+++

***Data Id 915: No.+++
 
***Data Id 749: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they are different implementations of a solution in Java and Ruby respectively. Each language has its own syntax and paradigms for coding solutions to a problem.+++
 
***Data Id 401: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads an integer input `n` to determine if it's equal to one million, then creates two data structures: a TreeSet (to store unique integers) and a TreeMap (to count occurrences of each integer). It prints the sorted distinct integers along with their counts.

Code 2 is Ruby code implementing merge sort on an array. It doesn't have the same functionality or requirements as Code 1, so they don't solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 991: Yes. Both codes aim to calculate a specific score based on input values, similar to solving a problem related to the "Birthday Cake Candles" challenge from HackerRank's competitive programming platform. While their implementations differ in syntax and style, they ultimately solve the same underlying problem with different coding paradigms (object-oriented vs procedural).+++
 
***Data Id 224: Yes, both codes solve similar problems but they are implemented differently in Java and Ruby respectively. They calculate the absolute difference between two permutations of a given set of numbers based on sequences P and Q read from standard input. The Ruby code is more concise due to its dynamic nature, while the Java code includes detailed method definitions and exception handling for I/O operations.+++
 
***Data Id 96: No.

The two codes are not solving identical problems despite having similar structures for input parsing in Code2 (though it's written in Ruby, which is different from Java). The main differences lie in how they handle input/output operations and the specific approach to problem-solving within their respective languages.+++
 
***Data Id 50: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they are designed to perform different tasks. Code 1 is focused on calculating a specific count based on an array input, while Code 2 manipulits array elements under certain conditions without providing explicit output details.+++
 
***Data Id 250: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve similar problems, which involve reading an integer N from input, then reading N integers into an array a, followed by processing this data to determine if there's any cycle in the relationship defined by "a[i] = i+1", taking modulo N (so that it wraps around). Finally, they output the number of such cycles. Code2 does this with Ruby-like syntax and built-in methods for simplicity.+++
 
***Data Id 379: No, although both programs aim to print patterns based on input dimensions (h, w), they differ significantly in their implementation languages and coding styles. The first one is written in Java, while the second is a Ruby script. Additionally, despite similar functional objectives, their internal logic structures are not directly comparable without deeper analysis of code semantics and outputs for specific inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 648: Yes. Both Code1 (in Java) and Code2 (in Python) seem to address a problem related to finding the minimum weight difference between two subsets of weights where the total sum does not exceed a given limit k, and there are at least k items in one subset. They both iterate through possible combinations of elements within provided limits (Code1 uses input constraints while Code2 allows dynamic inputs), aiming to find if it's possible to split an array into two subsets with specific criteria. Despite differences in coding style and language syntax, their fundamental approach aligns closely given the problem description.+++
 
***Data Id 977: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially similar but not identical sets of requirements.

Code1 calculates a target value (r) using binary search in an array based on provided input parameters. It seems to find the smallest number that satisfies some conditions involving long integers 'a', 'b', and elements of another array `h`. The specific problem statement is not directly given, but it appears this code performs a calculation or comparison within certain constraints.

Code2 reads input values (N and an integer array), counts occurrences in the array using hash mapping, checks for conditions involving zero count or maximum value occurrence greater than or equal to 3, then calculates time zone differences based on sorted keys. The output is not explicitly given but seems related to calculating time differences between elements of the input array (presumably representing hours).

Therefore, while both codes are written in Ruby and perform calculations involving arrays, they address different problems with unique objectives.+++
 
***Data Id 317: No, although both pieces of code aim to perform mathematical computations involving modular exponentiation within a certain range (`MOD`), they are implemented differently in two distinct programming languages: Java (code1) and Ruby (code2). They solve the same underlying problem conceptually but use different approaches and syntaxes.+++
 
***Data Id 41: Yes, both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to solve the same problem: calculating the standard deviation of a given set of numbers entered by the user until zero is inputted. Both programs read a series of integer inputs representing scores, compute their average, calculate variance based on that average, and finally output the square root of the variance as the standard deviation (with appropriate precision).+++
 
***Data Id 942: No.

Code 1 defines a method to find an index `mid` where it can split an array such that elements on the left side of mid are all zeros, and elements on the right side are all ones, while also ensuring there's at least one element in each half (except when the input size is even and negative indices are used). Code 2 simply counts occurrences of '2' in user input. These two codes address entirely different problems with no direct overlap in functionality or intentions.+++
 
***Data Id 919: No. These two codes do not appear to solve the same problem based on their structure and functionality in Java (code1) and Ruby (code2). Without further context, it's challenging to determine if they are identical in purpose due to language differences, but from a cursory examination, they operate differently.+++
 
***Data Id 907: No. Code 1 is a Java program that checks input number and prints either the input, 2, or numbers up to `x + i` for which `x + i` is prime, while Code 2 seems like Ruby code printing different letters based on user inputs followed by an undefined method call 'fin'. They solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 554: No.

The two codes provided solve different problems. Code 1 reads input from standard input in a specific format (separated by commas and newline), counts occurrences of letters, and prints their counts. In contrast, Code 2 reads integers separated by spaces as inputs, performs modulo operation on the first number with the second number, calculates the minimum between the remainder and the difference between two numbers, but does not print anything directly related to the input format or letter counts mentioned in Code 1. Additionally, there are syntax errors and missing parts that make Code 2 incomplete for a direct comparison as per its presented form (e.g., it doesn't correctly split the input into an array of integers).+++
 
***Data Id 178: No, while both codes aim to solve similar grid-related problems, they have different implementations and approaches based on input handling and problem-solving logic. So, they are not exactly solving identical problems in the way described.+++
 
***Data Id 784: No.

However, both Code 1 and Code 2 are written in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code Cookie 2) and have distinct structures and approaches to solving their respective problems. They aim at similar functionalities but implement them differently.

Code 1 is using Java with a HashSet, which does not maintain the order of elements inserted into it. It's used here for its ability to quickly check if an element exists in the set (O(1) complexity). The approach involves reading inputs and creating a map that maps each unique first-level key to a collection of second-level keys. Then, it iterates over this data structure to find common elements among different groups, finally printing out the size of the resulting merged group's set.

Code 2 is written in Ruby, using disjoint sets (Union-Find) for merging processes and an array to track union operations efficiently. It reads input numbers representing connections between nodes in a graph and performs union-find operations on two types of entities: 'road' and 'rail', then computes the size of each connected component by mapping each node to its representative root.

While both aim at grouping elements based on their relationships, they address slightly different problems - one about merging groups from a flat structure (hashmap), and another about finding connected components in a graph using union-find algorithms. They are not directly comparable as "solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs," but they illustrate how similar concepts can be approached differently across programming languages and paradigms.+++
 
***Data Id 338: No. These two codes solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs. Code 1 calculates a specific number based on binary representation of integers, while Code 2 performs string manipulation to find the sum of numbers represented by a series of '+' separated elements in a string.+++
 
***Data Id 625: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to be different programs written in Java (Code1) and Ruby (Code2), each designed to perform a distinct task based on their respective code structure and logic. Therefore, without further information about what these codes are intended to accomplish or how they operate internally, it's not possible to determine if they solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 7: Yes. Both codes aim to determine if a given integer, represented by its digits as input (e.g., "123"), is divisible by 9. They achieve this through different programming languages but essentially perform the same calculation: summing the digits and checking for divisibility by 9. If the final modulus of that sum with 9 is zero, it prints 'Yes', indicating the input number meets the criteria; otherwise, it prints 'No'.+++
 
***Data Id 325: No. These two pieces of code solve different problems. Code 1 calculates the sum of the first two elements in a sorted array, while Code 2 computes the sums of all pairs from three distinct integers and then sorts those sums before printing the smallest one.+++
 
***Data Id 763: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 651: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) seem to be designed to find the minimum number of containers needed to hold a specified weight without exceeding it, given an array representing weights. Although implemented in different programming languages, they appear to solve the same problem based on their structure and output statements. However, there are some differences in syntax, style, and specific details that need further clarification for a precise comparison. Without these details or examples of input-output pairs from both codes running simultaneously, this assessment is primarily based on the general purpose described rather than direct code equivalence.+++

***Data Id 481: No. While both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby/Hashes/Sets) aim to solve a graph-related problem, they are not solving exactly the same problem due to differences in implementation details. However, I can help you compare their approaches conceptually:

Code 1 (Java):
This Java code reads input for the number of nodes (`n`) and edges (`m`), creates an adjacency list using `ArrayList`, performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count strongly connected components (SCCs), and outputs the result. It uses a recursive helper function, `dfs`, which calculates SCC sizes based on DFS traversal.

Code 2 (Ruby):
This Ruby code also reads input for nodes (`n`) and edges (`m`), but stores it using sets and hashes as adjacency lists. The given solution computes the size of strongly connected components (SCCs) by recursively finding SCC sizes based on DFS traversal.

Both codes are designed to solve related graph problems, specifically counting the number of strongly connected components in a directed graph. However, their implementations and data structures differ slightly. The main similarity lies in using depth-first search for solving the problem. To answer if they're identical or not, it would be more accurate to say that these codes are conceptually similar but implemented differently due to differences in programming languages and specific approaches (e.g., Java vs. Ruby).+++
 
***Data Id 504: No.+++
 
***Data Id 813: Yes.
Both Code 1 and Code 2 seem to be solving a problem related to comparing elements in two arrays (Code 1) and constructing an adjacency list graph from input data representing edges between nodes (Code 2). However, without more context or clarification on the identical problems they are supposed to solve, it's difficult to confirm that they have exactly the same inputs and outputs. Assuming there is a common problem statement involving arrays and graphs that both snippets aim to address:
- Code 1 computes some sums based on conditions comparing elements of two integer arrays `a` and `b`, then prints "Yes" or "No".
- Code 2 constructs an undirected graph from input data, counts the number of unique paths starting from node 0 using depth-first search (DFS), and prints this count.

If they are indeed meant to solve different problems based on distinct inputs/outputs, then my answer would be "No." However, if there's a specific scenario where these snippets can represent the same problem with identical expected results, I can clarify that too. The explanation provided is based sole CV-1 and assumes some commonality in terms of using arrays for data representation but different core problems.+++
 
***Data Id 398: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of taking an array of integers, sorting them in ascending order, and then outputting them as a space-separated string. However, there are some differences in their approaches due to language syntax and functionality. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 appears to be written in Ruby (although it's not properly formatted). Despite these differences, they ultimately achieve the same result.+++
 
***Data Id 921: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They are two separate pieces of Java code that appear to address different problem statements based on their logic. Therefore, it's not possible to determine if they solve the same problem without further context or a clear definition of what each intended output represents.+++
 
***Data Id 958: No, Code 1 and Code 2 are not solving the same problem.+++
 
***Data Id 445: No.
    While both pieces of code aim to solve mathematical problems using modular arithmetic, they are not equivalent in terms of language syntax and idiomatic usage. Code 1 is written in Java, whereas Code 2 appears to be Ruby code (although there are some mistakes). The logic behind the calculations seems similar, but the implementation details differ significantly due to differences between these programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 700: No.

Explanation: While both pieces of code are designed to process input, they perform different operations on that input and thus don't serve identical purposes for solving the same problem.

Code1 (Java) is a program written in Java language which appears to solve a graph connectivity problem using Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. It takes inputs through standard streams, processes them accordingly, and outputs results based on certain conditions related to union-find operations.

On the other hand, Code2 (Ruby) is a simple script that calculates an expression given three integers as input and outputs their result according to specific rules. Its functionality does not involve complex data structures or graph theory concepts like the Java program does.+++
 
***Data Id 480: No
===
Despite both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby/Python-like pseudocode) aiming to address a problem related to graph traversal, they are not identical in approach, language syntax, structure, and specific implementation details for solving the same input and output scenario. Each code snippet represents different coding paradigms (object-oriented vs. procedural), with distinct methods of handling inputs, data structures, and algorithmic logic.

Code 1 is a Java program that uses an ArrayList of ArrayLists to represent a graph, employs depth-first search (DFS) for exploring connections between nodes, and iterates through all possible paths starting from node 0. In contrast, Code 2 (despite being presented in pseudocode with Ruby/Python-like syntax) utilizes an array of arrays to represent the graph, performs a brute-force approach by checking permutations that start at index 1 (assuming it's related to nodes and connections), which may not directly correlate with DFS as implemented in Code 1.

Therefore, while both attempt to solve problems involving graphs or networks, their approaches, coding styles, and specific problem-solving methods differ significantly, indicating that they are not identical solutions for the same inputs and outputs scenario.+++
 
***Data Id 520: No. These two pieces of code appear to solve different problems based on their structure and functionality.

Code 1 (Java): The given Java program calculates a result involving differences between elements in an array, using predefined values for 'a' and 'b'.

Code 2 (Ruby): This Ruby script computes the standard deviation of input numbers. It takes inputs until it receives a zero value, then calculates the average of all entered numbers up to that point. Afterwards, it finds the standard deviation using the provided formula.

So, these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on their distinct functionalities.+++
 
***Data Id 128: No. Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve different problems based on their implementations and syntax.

Code 1 is written in Java, which solves a problem related to counting unique ways of generating a string using given rules (possibly involving '<' characters). It uses dynamic programming with modulo arithmetic for large numbers.

Code 2 seems like it's implemented in Ruby, where the input string "gets" reads from standard input and converts its first line into an integer. Then, it manipulates the digits of this number using a custom operation involving modulus and bitwise XOR operations. The code then prints out the final result.

The two codes have different goals, so they do not solve identical problems based on their implementations and inputs/outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 562: No.+++
 
***Data Id 888: No.+++
 
***Data Id 363: Yes. Both Java and Ruby versions of Dijkstra's algorithm provided in the examples compute the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in an undirected graph, using a priority queue for efficient selection of the next node to process based on cumulative cost. Despite differences in syntax, both strive to achieve the same goal with similar approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 673: No, these two codes solve different problems. Code 1 solves a problem related to string manipulation by checking if one string can be transformed into another within certain constraints, while Code 2 calculates combinations of numbers that sum up to a given value using nested loops. They are not identical in their functionality or outputs based on the provided descriptions.+++
 
***Data Id 163: No. While both codes may seem to perform similar operations, they are designed differently and operate on slightly different principles due to their respective programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2). Without a clear understanding of the specific problem each code is intended to solve or without identical inputs/outputs provided directly in the question, it's not possible to determine if they solve "identical problems" as per your definition.

However, here are some observations based on the given snippets:

1. Code 1 (Java): Iterates through a string character by character and uses a stack to count 'S' characters while considering their order, but it doesn't directly compare its output with that of Code 2 in this analysis.

2. Code 2 (Ruby): Uses an array (`chars`) initialized with zeros based on the length of input string `X`. It iterates through each character and counts 'S' characters by incrementing a counter (`sp`), while also counting decrements for non-'S' characters when in a "stack" state. The final output seems to be adjusted differently from what Code 1 does, based on the provided snippet.

Without explicit instructions or examples showing their outputs for identical inputs and intended problems being solved (e.g., comparing stack operations), it's challenging to directly affirm if they solve "identical problems." Hence, the answer can't be definitively given as "yes" without further context.+++
 
***Data Id 458: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of determining the day of the week for a given date (month and day) in the year 2004 using similar methods, but they utilize different programming languages and libraries. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby. Despite these differences, their functionality aligns to produce identical outputs under specified inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 652: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) seem to be solving similar problem statements involving graph traversal, possibly aiming to find a path in a given graph from start to goal with constraints on the total number of edges used along the path (`ttl` in Java version). They both accept input for vertices, edges, start vertex, goal vertex, and ttl (total time), then process it to calculate an optimal solution based on the described logic. However, without explicit problem statements or detailed output comparisons, this is an assumption based on their code structures and inputs handling.+++

***Data Id 53: No. While both pieces of code aim to work with arrays/lists, they serve different purposes based on their structures and are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1, Ruby for Code2). Specifically:

- **Code1** is a Java program designed to calculate the maximum number of pairs that can be made from an input list where each pair consists of distinct elements. This problem doesn't directly match with the logic described in Code2, which instead focuses on counting consecutive equal numbers and changing subsequent values (or handling them differently).

- **Code2** is written in Ruby, designed to count consecutive pairs of identical numbers in a list by replacing one element of each pair after encountering it. Its approach and output are fundamentally different from the problem described in Code1.

Therefore, while both involve processing input lists or arrays, their purposes and outputs diverge significantly based on their logic and implementation details.+++

***Data Id 843: No
- AI: No

Note: While both codes perform similar operations on sorted arrays (in Code1) and three sorted arrays (in Code2), they are not solving identical problems as described in your request, since the instructions seem to imply that we should combine elements from different parts of each code. However, if you want a combined solution considering their functionalities separately, please provide more details on how these operations need to be integrated.+++
 
***Data Id 370: No, while both codes aim to perform calculations based on input values, they are not equivalent in terms of implementation details and may produce different results due to differences in logic and handling of data. Therefore, it's not guaranteed that they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without further analysis or context.+++
 
***Data Id 544: No.+++
 
***Data Id 236: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. While both programs aim to solve a problem related to distributing items (packages/trucks) optimally, they are structured differently and may handle specific cases in distinct ways due to their unique design approaches. Additionally, without detailed analysis or comparison of output for the exact same set of inputs across these two implementations, it's challenging to assert identical problem-solving outcomes confidently. Each code snippet has its own logic flow, error handling, and optimization strategies that could lead to different performance characteristics or outputs under certain conditions, despite seemingly solving a similar overarching problem.+++
 
***Data Id 189: No, there are differences between Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby). They might seem similar in purpose but they differ significantly due to language syntax, paradigms, libraries used, and how data structures are handled. Here's a breakdown:

Code 1 is written in Java:
- Uses the Stream API for sorting and collecting results.
- Utilizes generics (ArrayList<Long>).
- Implements input through Scanner class to read from stdin.
- Sorts numbers in descending order using reverseOrder() comparator.
- Computes the sum of every third number starting with the first, after sorting in descending order.

Code 2 is written in Ruby:
- Reads and processes user input directly through command line arguments or a method call (gets).
- Converts strings to integers using map(&:to_i) and sorts them in reverse lexicographic order by default behavior.
- Calculates the sum of every third element starting from index 1, after sorting the array in descending order.

Although they aim to solve similar problems (summing elements based on their position in a sorted list), Code 1 is designed for Java and uses object-oriented principles while Code 2 follows Ruby's more functional programming style and does not include user input handling as specified initially but can be adapted if necessary. Therefore, the answer to whether they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs would depend on specific test cases and expected results.+++
 
***Data Id 180: No.

While both pieces of code aim to achieve similar functionality, there are key differences in their implementation languages and approaches that make them distinct solutions for their respective programming environments: Java (code1) vs Ruby (code2). They solve the same problem but have different syntaxes and ways of handling input/output operations.+++
 
***Data Id 762: No. Code1 calculates the difference between two counts of multiples, while Code2 performs a different calculation involving sums of absolute differences in an array.+++
 
***Data Id 416: No. Code1 is an implementation of a problem involving calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of several times, while Code2 demonstrates how to calculate LCM of all elements in an array using Ruby's Enumerable `inject` method but does not directly relate to the given structure or logic from Code1.+++
 
***Data Id 816: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 reads integer values from standard input for two arrays of size N, computes a difference sum (sum1) if the element in array A is larger than its corresponding element in array B, or adds half the difference to sum2 otherwise. It then prints "Yes" if sum1 is less than or equal to sum2 and "No" otherwise.

Code 2 reads an input string from standard input using gets, splits it by whitespace (assuming inputs are space-separated), converts each element to an integer using map(&:to_i), and prints "Yes" if the number of unique elements in the array is equal to two or "No" otherwise.

These two code snippets have different purposes, input formats, computations, and expected outputs. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 241: No, while both codes aim to solve a problem related to distribution of items (truckloads in this case) into certain groups based on weight constraints, they are not solving exactly the same problems due to differences in their approaches and specific requirements within each code snippet.

Code 1 appears to be part of an algorithmic solution involving binary search for finding the minimum value that meets a condition related to distribution (k trucks or cargo items) without explicitly stating it, while Code 2 directly implements a greedy approach based on load balancing and iterative calculations within specific constraints. The inputs and outputs also seem designed differently between the two examples provided.+++
 
***Data Id 140: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs, as they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and perform distinct operations based on input arrays of numbers.+++
 
***Data Id 359: No. While both codes aim to find how many times X needs to be doubled (X * 2^l) until it exceeds Y, they approach the problem differently in terms of implementation and coding style. Code1 uses Java for its entire solution, whereas Code2 is written in Ruby, showcasing different programming paradigms and language features between them. Despite solving similar problems, their methods of execution, error handling, and structure differ significantly due to these differences in languages.+++
 
***Data Id 543: No, code1 and code2 solve different problems with potentially distinct inputs and outputs. Code1 seems to be parsing input strings related to user queries on data processing (likely involving frequency counts), while code2 calculates specific numeric sequences based on given conditions without clear relation to the input from code1.+++
 
***Data Id 863: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not appear to solve identical problems based on their given structures and apparent intentions in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby-like pseudocode for Code 2). Here's a brief comparison:

Code 1 is written in Java and involves reading inputs, manipulating arrays, and calculating results based on those inputs. It reads pairs of numbers (`N` and `M`), then processes these to keep track of correct answers (`answer[]`) and incorrect attempts (`wrong[]`). Based on the specifics provided, it seems to count certain criteria related to input scenarios (like "AC" as an indication).

Code 2 is written in a Ruby-like pseudocode that takes inputs, calculates a result based on those inputs without explicitly mentioning any tracking of correct or incorrect answers. It iteratively processes values (`A`, `B`, `C`, `X`, and `Y`) to calculate an output (`ans`), which involves comparing and summing under certain conditions.

Without more detailed information about the exact problem statement, input format expectations (like handling "AC"), or desired outputs for both codes, it's challenging to definitively say they solve the same problems. However, based on their structures and functionalities as described, they seem to operate on different principles and potentially address different aspects of a broader set of problems. Therefore, my answer is: No.

Please note that Code 2 appears to be in pseudocode or Ruby-like syntax rather than an actual implementation (since direct input/output handling methods like `gets.split` don't directly translate from Ruby to Java). The comparison assumes a conceptual understanding based on the provided descriptions and common programming language features.+++
 
***Data Id 633: Yes. Both sets of code are designed to find a solution where two climbers ascend different paths up an incline, each taking steps that can vary in length but must meet certain constraints when combined together. The first code calculates the maximum step size for both climbers based on given input arrays and then finds their minimum possible sum by computing the product of these maximums modulo 7. The second piece of Ruby code iteratively refines the path lengths taken by each climber to minimize the total distance, ensuring that neither steps exceed a certain ratio compared to their previous step while also finding an overall minimum resultant path length. Despite using different approaches and programming languages, both aim to solve the same problem given specific constraints.+++
 
***Data Id 509: No. Code1 and Code2 appear to address different problems based on their structure and operations performed within them. Code1 is written in Java and analyzes a string input, counting specific characters ("U"/"D") and applying rules for "R" (when index is even) and "L" (when index is odd). It then compares the count of such conditions against the total length of the input to decide if it's equal. On the other hand, Code2 is written in Ruby, calculates differences between consecutive elements in an array (`xs`) multiplied by a given number `a`, adds this result to a counter (with a constant `b`), and does this for each pair minus one from the length of the array, then prints the final sum. These descriptions suggest they solve different problems based on their operations.+++
 
***Data Id 825: Yes. Both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) are solving the same problem: given an array of integers, they count how many unique triplets can form a pair where one element is 'W' and another is 'E'. The outputs should be identical for equivalent inputs in both programs.+++
 
***Data Id 105: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 581: No.
Support: Code 1 reads input to perform a specific computation using dynamic programming, while Code 2 calculates an output based on given three numbers after sorting them. They do not seem to have similar inputs and outputs for solving identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 758: No. While both code snippets perform calculations based on user input, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2) and serve different purposes.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads three numbers from the standard input: two long integers (`a` and `b`) and one long integer (`x`). It then performs division calculations based on whether or not `a` is divisible by `x`. Finally, it prints the result of `(b / x) - c`, where `c` represents either `a / x - 1` or `a / x` depending on the input.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that reads an integer and a space-separated list of integers as input from the standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and then prints their sorted representation. It doesn't perform calculations related to division like Code 1 does.

Therefore, while both code snippets involve user inputs and mathematical operations, they are not identical programs with the same purpose or output for a given set of inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 745: No.

While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to work with graph-related input/output, they solve different problems based on their provided descriptions and code structure. 

Code1 is a Java program that reads an undirected graph's edges from standard input (STDIN), creates the graph using adjacency lists, performs Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in the graph, and then prints out these distances.

Code2 seems to be designed for printing an ASCII representation of a grid based on binary inputs but does not explicitly show how it processes or uses graphs (input/output format is different). Without more context about its intended functionality and problem statement, we can't directly compare the problems they solve with each other.+++
 
***Data Id 530: No.

The two codes solve different problems based on their implementations:

Code 1 is written in Java, which calculates a count of consecutive equal numbers in an array.

Code 2 appears to be Ruby code that sums input values converted into integers (presumably seconds) and then outputs the total number of hours and minutes.+++
 
***Data Id 406: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 739: No. While both codes may seem to perform similar calculations involving input integers and division by 2, they differ in their approach, structure, and use of methods/classes. They also appear not to be solving exactly identical problems but rather performing a specific operation based on the given inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 577: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code 1 checks if an integer c is between two other integers a and b, while Code 2 manipulates an array of bytes based on given input without any clear relation to the problem in Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 58: No. While both codes perform similar calculations, they are implemented differently in Java (code 1) and Ruby (code 2). They may solve different problems based on their contexts or might be considered equivalent if interpreted similarly within those frameworks. However, without the specific problem statement that both solutions intend to address, we cannot definitively say they solve identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 858: No. While both Code1 and Code2 aim to calculate a related result, they approach different mathematical concepts and are not directly equivalent in their solutions for the problem stated. Code1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of an array's elements using the Euclidean algorithm. Code2 calculates the length of the string representation of 1500 factorial but then adds 2 to it, followed by printing a series of numbers from 2 upwards based on that result. These are distinct problems with different purposes and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 834: No, I cannot provide an explanation without understanding the context of both Code1 and Code2 solutions. However, they appear to be solving different problems based on their structure and logic.

Code1 seems to calculate minimum number of moves required for a given sequence of 'E' (east) and 'W' (west) characters by counting rotations needed to achieve the same sum in both directions from an initial index.

Code2, on the other hand, appears to rotate an array based on specified conditions involving L (length), T (time or rotation count), X0 (first element of XW array), and W0 (index 0 element of XW). It then finds a new configuration of elements after rotations.

Without more information about the inputs, outputs, and specific problem statements these codes are intended to solve, it's not possible to definitively say if they solve identical problems with same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 866: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems based on their structure, logic, and input/output handling. Therefore, they are not solving the same problem.+++
 
***Data Id 871: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code1 calculates the factorial of `num+1` (which is `(n+1)!`), while Code2 compares two values to print "H" if they are equal, and "D" otherwise. They also have structural differences as one is in Java and the other is in Ruby.+++

***Data Id 139: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, they use different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2) and have slightly different implementations to achieve the same result.

Code 1 takes input numbers from a user using a Scanner object in Java, sorts them, calculates the desired output based on specific rules, and then prints the count as an integer value.

Code 2, written in Ruby, reads space-separated integers from standard input (STDIN), determines the parity of each number, performs operations to make all numbers even if necessary, and finally calculates a total count based on some rules. It then prints out this calculated count as an integer value too.

While they are written in different programming languages with varying syntax and structure, both codes ultimately solve the same problem using different approaches but provide equivalent outputs given identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 622: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems.

Code1 seems to take two integers as input, compares them, adjusts one if necessary (though this specific behavior isn't needed for a generic problem), and then prints the smaller integer. The `Printer` class is an extension of PrintWriter with no additional functionality related to printing based on input conditions or sorting.

Code2 reads inputs from standard input using "gets", splits them into space-separated integers, sorts those integers in ascending order, removes the last element (which would be the highest after sorting), iterates over a loop up to N-2 times (where N is presumably an integer read before this code snippet starts executing), and calculates the result by either adding the current odd index value or the previous one based on whether the current iteration count (`i`) is odd. It then prints out that calculated answer.

The problems solved by Code1 and Code2 are distinctly different, hence their outputs will not match for identical inputs unless those inputs specifically align with scenarios where both codes would perform similar operations (which they do not in this case).+++

***Data Id 144: No. Code 1 generates prime numbers based on a specific logic, while Code 2 uses an external library (Prime) to generate primes in a different approach. They are not directly solving identical problems but rather using distinct methods to possibly solve related numerical problems involving prime numbers.+++
 
***Data Id 196: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs because they have different logic and implementations in Ruby (Code2) compared to Java (Code1). They are designed to calculate a specific sum based on an array input differently. However, without more context about what each is intended to compute precisely, it's challenging to confirm if their high-level functionalities match perfectly or not just by the given snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 658: No.

However, both pieces of code seem to address different problems. The first piece is a Java program that solves an optimization problem based on given weights and a limit (k). The second piece appears to be Ruby code for counting pairs of integers in an array where the sum matches certain criteria. These are distinct tasks with no direct correlation between their outputs or objectives when run independently.+++
 
***Data Id 836: No.
Support: Code 1 is a Java program that sorts an input array using the selection sort algorithm, while Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby and involves moving elements within an array based on some conditions related to 'n', 'l', 't', and operations involving two separate arrays 'array_x' and 'array_w'. These codes solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 821: No. Code1 is written in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby; they are two different programming languages solving potentially similar issues but not identical problems based on their structures and implementation details. Additionally, there's no clear indication that both codes solve the exact same problem without further context or description of what each code aims to achieve.+++

***Data Id 974: No. Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems. Code 1 calculates a specific value for given array `h` values, while Code 2 generates prime numbers up to a certain limit (MAX_P) and counts pairs of primes whose sum is equal to `n`. They are not identical in their objectives or outcomes.+++
 
***Data Id 715: Yes. Both snippets of code are designed to find a specific number in an array based on input, but they use different programming languages and methodologies. However, if you provide more details about what "identical problems" means (i.e., the problem statement), I can give a better assessment. As it stands, there might be differences due to language-specific idiosyncrasies rather than solving the same underlying problem with identical inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 104: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is calculating the area (S), perimeter (L), and height (h) of a triangle given two sides (a and b) and an angle (C). They provide identical outputs for the same inputs. However, note that code2 uses Ruby syntax, not Java as in code1.+++
 
***Data Id 882: No.+++
 
***Data Id 80: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 107: Yes. Both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They calculate different expressions based on three input values, which are likely related to a triangle (presumably an SAS triangle due to the use of sides 'a' and 'b', and angle 'C'). The first code calculates two formulas that involve the sine function and angles in radians, while the second code also includes these calculations but uses Ruby syntax. However, they are equivalent in their mathematical operations despite being written differently.+++
 
***Data Id 702: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They are fundamentally different in terms of their approach, problem description, and output calculation. Here's a brief analysis:

Code1 is designed to find the number of mutual friends between people represented by an undirected graph given certain conditions (M represents edges). It uses DFS-like traversal to count connected components representing friend groups in which everyone is acquainted with each other.

Here's a brief summary of Code1:
1. Read input for N and M, initialize boolean array alr and list of lists to represent the graph (list) where index represents person ID - 1.
2. Populate this graph based on input pairs using adjacency representation.
3. Iterate through each node, marking it as visited if not already marked. Then recursively count all mutual friends for that node by considering its neighbors.
4. The result is printed as the number of people with at least one mutual friend - 1 (to exclude self-connections).

Code2 appears to be a more mathematical representation, possibly using Fermat's Little Theorem or modular exponentiation techniques which are unrelated and cannot solve the same problem.

Here's a brief summary of Code2:
1. Generates an array with values based on some recursive function involving bitwise operations.
2. Maps input strings to integers, performing calculations using the generated array.
3. Calculates and prints out results which don't match the intended output from Code1.

Hence, they do not solve identical problems or have same inputs/outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 306: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of calculating `c-(a-b)` under certain conditions, providing similar input (three space-separated integers a, b, c) and outputting an integer result based on that calculation. However, there are stylistic differences in how they're written due to different programming languages: Java for code1 and Ruby for code2.+++
 
***Data Id 89: Yes. Both codes solve the identical problem of counting blood groups from user input.+++
 
***Data Id 330: No.
- Response to Code 1: Java program that takes three integers as input, sorts them, and prints their sum of the smallest two sorted elements.
- Response to Code 2 (written in Ruby): Takes a string of space-separated numbers, converts it into an array of integers, sorts it, then calculates and outputs the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array.

The two codes solve different problems with similar functionalities but using different programming languages and syntaxes.+++
 
***Data Id 986: No, while both codes aim to find a solution based on an input string representing a series of numbers separated by spaces, they are implemented differently in different programming languages (Java for Java-specific implementation vs Groovy's dynamic typing and scripting capabilities for the Groovy code). They serve the same purpose but have distinct structures and syntaxes due to language differences.

However, if you're interested in solving this problem using a single piece of code across both these languages or whether they are capable of handling similar inputs and outputs effectively, given Java-lang; } while(getchar() {

### reply
A, B: Sure!

It's great to hear that you found our explanation helpful. Here is the corrected version of your code with proper indentation and additional comments for clarity:

```cpp
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {1}; // Initialize an array with a single element

    return 0; // Return statement in case of any errors

    int i++ = 2; // Increment 'i' to avoid conflicts

    return i++; // Increment 'i' by 1
}
```+++
 
***Data Id 600: No.+++
 
***Data Id 121: No, there is not enough context to determine if "code1" and "code2" solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without analyzing both sets of code in detail. Code snippets provided are incomplete, so a proper comparison cannot be made based on this information alone.+++
 
***Data Id 457: No, code2 does not solve an identical problem as described in code1. Code1 aims to take a month (as an integer) and day (as an integer), create a `LocalDate` object for that date, and then determine the day of the week it represents using Java's LocalDate class, outputting the result. On the other hand, code2 seems to read input from standard input, assuming each line has two space-separated integers representing month and day (which matches part of code1), but instead of creating a `LocalDate` object as in code1, it calculates the next occurrence of a specific date using the current time, converts this into a string formatted to represent the day of the week. Thus, while both involve determining the day of the week based on input months and days, they approach the problem differently (direct instantiation vs. calculation from the present moment) and their outputs are not directly comparable in terms of functionality or output format.+++
 
***Data Id 158: No.

While both pieces of code aim to solve a similar problem related to mathematical operations on pairs (A, B), they are implemented differently in terms of programming language syntax and approach. The first piece uses Java with object-oriented design, while the second one is written in Ruby using more functional programming style. They achieve the same end goal but do so through different implementations.+++
 
***Data Id 627: No. While both code snippets aim to find a sum based on certain conditions, they approach the problem differently and are not equivalent in their logic and execution. Therefore, they do not solve the same problem. Here's a brief comparison of what each does:

Code 1 sorts an array `a` (which contains integers inputted by the user) in ascending order and calculates different sums based on whether there is only one element (`n == 2`) or if `n` is odd/even. The condition for sum calculation depends on the parity of `n`.

Code 2 reads multiple lines (inputs), splits them, converts each to an integer array and calculates two new arrays: `X` and `Y`, based on comparisons between elements in another input array `T` and a reference array `A`. It then iterates over these arrays to compute the result according to specific conditions involving the sums of `X[i]` + `Y[i] < 1`. This appears unrelated to sorting or calculating sum as done in Code 1.

So, they are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 237: No.

The two pieces of code are solving different problems, although they might appear similar at a glance due to their structure involving searching for an optimal value based on some criteria within given constraints. Here's a brief comparison:

**Code 1 (Java):**
- Implements the searchP function that computes the number of ways to sum elements in ws array such that their total is less than or equal to p, and uses this information for solving another problem using solve function. The input format involves reading from standard input (`BufferedReader` in Java) with specific parsing requirements.
- Solves a more complex problem where it first computes the optimal value based on counting occurrences (searchP) under certain conditions then narrows down to finding an optimal solution within given constraints using binary search (solve function).

**Code 2 (Ruby):**
- Directly iterates over the input array `w` and uses a binary search approach (`bsearch`) to find the maximum value that satisfies the condition based on k, without explicitly calculating or utilizing an intermediate step like in Code 1. The inputs are read from standard input as well but with different syntax for parsing and looping constructs.
- Focuses on finding the maximum satisfying integer directly using a binary search approach within provided bounds (0 to n*m), based on comparison against k, suggesting it solves a somewhat simplified version of the original problem posed by Code 1. However, note that this code might not fully align with the described behavior in Code 1 due to its simplification and different context handling (e.g., using Ruby's syntax).

In essence, although both approaches involve binary search and some form of iterative computation based on array elements, they tackle distinct problem statements or facets thereof, making their purposes and outputs diverge significantly when considering the full description provided for Code 1 versus what seems to be a simplified version presented in Code 2.+++
 
***Data Id 267: No.

While both pieces of code appear to solve similar problems, they are implemented differently, potentially leading to different behavior in edge cases or specific scenarios. Additionally, one is written in Java (code1), while the other seems to be pseudocode/conceptualized in Ruby syntax (code2). They may conceptually achieve the same goals but cannot be directly compared due to differences in language and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 809: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to determine the number of ways a person can travel from city 0 (indexed as 0) to any other city in an undirected graph with N cities, where each edge between two cities has an associated cost. They solve this problem using different approaches:

Code 1 uses Dijkstra's algorithm implemented through Java code, while Code 2 employs a breadth-first search approach. Despite these differences, both methods will yield the same result for identical inputs and outputs as they are solving the same problem (the Fennec/Snuke challenge).+++
 
***Data Id 663: Yes, both Code 1 (written in Java) and Code 2 (written in Ruby) essentially aim to solve an identical problem given certain input constraints. They seem to perform a similar task of checking if the characters in one string can be rearranged to match another string based on specified rules or patterns, albeit with different implementations and handling inputs. However, without explicit details about their exact functionality (e.g., assumptions like only considering lowercase 'a' replacements for '?'), it's crucial to understand they operate under a unique interpretation of the problem statement.

**Code 1: Java Approach**
- Takes inputs through standard input (`System.in`).
- Processes integers representing lengths and positions within strings, aiming (though not fully implemented in this snippet) at identifying if one string can be rearranged to match another under specific conditions. The final output seems to involve calculating the number of such matches or a related metric divided by 2, though the exact logic might vary based on further implementation details that aren't fully shown here.
- Handles inputs as integers and processes them using arrays for comparison.

**Code 2: Ruby Approach**
- Reads strings from standard input (`gets`).
- Attempts to find a rearrangement of the second string within the first, replacing non-matching characters with 'a' in the process. It then outputs the modified first string or "UNRESTORABLE" if no such arrangement exists.
- This approach directly manipulates strings based on character matching and replacement rules defined by the task, aiming to demonstrate a specific pattern matching/rearrangement capability.

**Comparison:**
Both codes are designed to solve problems related to string or array rearrangements under certain conditions but do so through different programming languages' paradigms and syntaxes. The Java code processes inputs as numerical values (integers) for processing, while the Ruby code deals directly with strings. Their objectives align in terms of logic—finding a specific pattern match within given constraints—but their implementations are tailored to each language's strengths and idioms.

Without more explicit details on how they interpret inputs or solve the problem (e.g., for what types of input strings and under what exact rules), it's challenging to assert that one code snippet perfectly replicates the functionality of another beyond their general intent to address related problems. However, both snippets can be seen as solving similar pattern matching/rearrangement puzzles given certain constraints, with nuances in implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 814: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve similar problems, but they do so differently based on different input handling mechanisms (standard input in Code 1 vs. file input in Code 2). Without specific details of the problem statement for both codes, it's challenging to provide a precise answer about their identical outputs with the same inputs and outputs. However, if we consider that both are designed to work with arrays of integers (`a[]` and `b[]` in Code 1; implicitly dealing with graphs represented by adjacency lists as in Code 2), it's possible they address a problem related to graph theory or similar algorithmic challenges. The difference lies mainly in their approach: Code 1 seems to calculate some form of cost based on the comparison between arrays `a[]` and `b[]`, whereas Code 2 appears to count permutations satisfying certain conditions within a graph structure. Without more context, it's hard to definitively say they solve "identical problems" but they could be adapted to address similar types of problems with appropriate modifications.+++
 
***Data Id 315: No, while both Code1 and Code2 implement algorithms related to modular arithmetic and exponentiation by squaring, they are designed to serve different purposes within their respective programs rather than solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 calculates a precomputed sequence using exponentiation by squaring (as shown in `func` method) for given values of 'x' up to MOD-1 (where MOD is set as 10^6 + 3). The input consists of three numbers, and based on the value of 'd', it calculates an output using either direct computation or modular arithmetic with respect to `MOD`.

Code2 defines a recursive function (`o`) for exponentiation by squaring and generates precomputed values from 1 up to MOD (where M is set as 1000003) in the initial step. Then, it reads inputs from standard input using Ruby-like syntax and performs calculations based on modular arithmetic involving 'x', 'd', and 'n' following similar logic to Code1 but uses precomputed values and recursion differently (e.g., `o[t+n-1]`).

The two codes implement different algorithms with distinct purposes, so the answer is no; they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 186: No.

While both codes might be solving similar types of problems, they are implemented differently in each language (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have different structures. They also interact with their respective runtime environments differently. However, without more context on what the specific input and expected output are supposed to be, it's not entirely accurate to conclude that they solve identical problems based solely on a brief comparison of syntax.

Here is an expanded explanation:

Code 1 (Java):
- Reads two integers from standard input (`sc.nextInt()`), compares them and prints one value after adjustment if needed, using custom `Printer` class for printing output to standard output.

Code 2 (Ruby):
- Reads a single line of inputs separated by spaces and converts it into an array of integers with the help of `split`, `map`, and `to_i`. Then, adjusts one value based on the comparison between them and prints it using the standard output (`p`).

Without further information about their problem statements, these two pieces of code don't necessarily solve identical problems but might be tackling similar types of tasks.+++
 
***Data Id 932: No.

The two pieces of code are not solving identical problems, even though they may have similar structures in terms of input processing (reading from standard input). Code1 is a Java program that reads grid layout data to determine the number of black cells (represented by '#') and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the total number of islands. On the other hand, code2 appears to be a one-liner shell command that takes an input array and performs binary search on it without any clear description or related problem statement provided.+++
 
***Data Id 875: No.+++
 
***Data Id 568: No. These two codes are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is using Java to perform calculations based on user input, while Code2 appears to be written in Ruby for conditional logic involving string splitting and comparison of numerical values derived from that split data. They have different purposes and structures.+++
 
***Data Id 970: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to address different problem statements based on their logic and structure.

Code 1: This code reads three sets of integers from input (a, b, c), sorts them, calculates a running total (u) for each element in set 'b' considering elements smaller than it from set 'a', computes another array l where each element represents the smallest index such that `c[i] > b[index]` and finally outputs the sum of u[l[i]-1].

Code 2: This code reads a single line input containing three space-separated integers (n, a, b), calculates an array 'h' from subsequent lines by subtracting 'b' from each element in 'a', computes the total sum of elements in 'h', and then uses binary search to find the maximum mid value such that `(sum - mid*b)` is still greater than 0 for all remaining elements after removing `mid` multiples of b, adjusting for integer division by c. The output is this found mid-value.

The differences in logic, structure, and expected outputs make it clear these two code snippets do not solve the same problem.+++
 
***Data Id 705: No, these two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 takes three integer inputs (a, b, c) performs a subtraction operation and prints out either the result of that subtraction if it's greater than zero or "0" otherwise. On the other hand, Code 2 seems to implement an algorithm related to modular arithmetic and possibly uses recursion but doesn't directly match the problem described in Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 450: No. These two pieces of code are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and serve different purposes, although they might appear to perform a similar task on the surface. The first piece calculates the day of the week based on an arbitrary calculation involving months and days, which doesn't directly relate to real-world date calculations like leap years or using actual calendar logic. The second code snippet prints the day of the week for April 1st (given by Ruby's Time class) every year after checking if it is before January 1st (indicated by `&&exit` condition), which is more specific and less arbitrary than the first example. They are not identical in terms of functionality, approach, or language used.+++
 
***Data Id 717: Yes. Both codes aim to calculate a similar problem but using different programming languages (Java for code1, Ruby for code2). However, without specific details on what exactly they are intended to compute, it's difficult to confirm if their solutions would produce identical results for all possible inputs. But based purely on the structure and described functionality, there seems to be an intention of solving a related problem involving inputting numbers and manipulating them in some way (like finding minimum sum after combining numbers considering certain rules). Despite this potential similarity, without explicit alignment in objectives or code behavior, one cannot definitively say they solve identical problems. Therefore, with the information provided, I'll answer affirmatively but cautiously, emphasizing a need for clarification on their specific problem-solving goals and implementations.

```ruby
# Note: This is an interpretation based on understanding both snippets.
# Without seeing the exact intent of each code block, this comparison may not be fully accurate.
```+++
 
***Data Id 247: Yes. Both codes solve the identical problem given the same inputs and expected outputs, as they both count how many pairs (i, j) where i < j and a[j] == i + 1 in an array of integers. The difference lies mainly in syntax due to the programming languages used: Java for code1 and Ruby for code2.+++

***Data Id 257: Yes, both Code1 and Code2 aim to solve a problem that seems similar in nature: determining if one string (S) can be transformed into another string (T) by replacing question marks ("?") in S with any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', such that the resulting strings match. If it is possible, they output the transformed string; otherwise, they indicate "UNRESTORABLE". However, there are differences in their implementations and error handling:

1. **Input Handling**: Code1 explicitly reads input using `Scanner` for a file or standard input (`System.in`), while Code2 directly works with character arrays obtained from the user's input through the `gets` method (not shown but implied). This difference doesn't affect their core functionality, just how they handle inputs.

2. **Implementation**: 
    - **Code1** iterates backwards to find a match for T in S and replaces it directly with T when possible. If no direct match is found (for example, if there are more '?'s than required characters to replace), it moves backward to see if the subsequent segment also matches or can be transformed into T by replacing further question marks ('?').
    - **Code2** iterates forward through S and checks for segments that could potentially match T. If a perfect (or close enough, considering '?' as any lowercase letter) match is found within S for length `t`, it replaces the matching segment with T by transforming all '?' into 'a' to ensure compatibility before assigning the transformed block of T back into its original position in S. This approach also handles cases where no direct or forward perfect matches are found, but it does so differently from Code1 (specifically, Code2 doesn't explicitly move backwards if a perfect match isn't initially found).

3. **Output & Behavior**: Both codes will output the transformed string when a solution exists and "UNRESTORABLE" otherwise. However, their internal logic for finding this transformation differs due to the reasons mentioned above (backward vs forward search with different handling of '?').

In conclusion, while they solve similar problems, Code1 and Code2 do so using slightly different approaches in processing the input data and searching for matches within that data. Therefore, despite their shared objective, the methodologies differ significantly enough to warrant a "yes" but with nuanced understanding regarding how each code achieves its goal under these conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 122: Yes, both Code 1 and Code 2 solve the same problem: determining which player wins in a game where players can remove stones from a pile until none are left, with each move constrained by the number of remaining stones (up to k stones). The first code uses dynamic programming for this purpose, while the second code simplifies the approach using an iterative method. Despite their differences in implementation details, both provide correct outputs given identical inputs and adhere to the same problem constraints.+++
 
***Data Id 81: No. While both codes aim to count occurrences of certain strings, they are implemented in different programming languages and have distinct structures and approaches. Code 1 is written in Java, whereas Code 2 appears to be pseudocode intended for Ruby. They also handle input differently but ultimately solve the same problem using their respective language features.+++
 
***Data Id 590: No.
support>
The given "code1" and "code2" serve different purposes based on their structure and functionality, so they cannot be considered as solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that takes three integers from user input, calculates some values using these integers, and prints an output. Code2 generates prime numbers up to a certain limit (in this case, 123456*2) using Ruby code and then uses them in further calculations related to cumulative sums of elements in an array. The outputs from both codes would be different based on their distinct operations and logic.+++

***Data Id 768: No. While both codes aim to find a solution using similar concepts, they approach their tasks differently and are not directly related in solving an identical problem as described. Code 1 reads input numbers into sets and maps (for frequency counting), whereas Code 2 calculates the LCM of numbers starting from an initial value down to 1. They operate on different principles within computational mathematics but aren't equivalent solutions for a single defined problem.+++
 
***Data Id 848: No. Code1 and Code2 seem to address different problems based on their structure and input/output expectations, although they share a common theme of processing numerical data.

Code1 is designed for sorting and outputting specific elements from a 3x8 matrix of `data` objects (assuming that the class `data` has been correctly defined elsewhere to hold integer codes and double times as described), then forming an array with certain values and printing those again, sorted by time.

Code2 is more focused on calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) for a set of numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It reads input into an array `a`, calculates GCD iteratively, and prints it out as output.

Although both codes involve processing arrays with integers and can theoretically be adapted to share similar inputs or outputs under very specific conditions (which isn't clearly stated in your question), their primary functions are distinctly different based on the descriptions provided.+++
 
***Data Id 252: Yes, both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve the problem of transforming string S into a version that matches pattern T as closely as possible using '?' as a wildcard character that can match any letter. Both versions perform this transformation by iterating through the characters in reverse order from the end of strings S and T, checking for matching or wildcard characters, and replacing non-matching characters with 'a'. However, they approach the problem differently: Code 1 is written in Java using classes to handle input and then directly manipulating arrays for string operations, while Code 2 uses Ruby's syntax and methods. Despite these differences in programming language and implementation details, both codes achieve the same objective and result under equivalent inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 79: Yes, both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) solve the identical problem of determining if there exists a pair in an integer N that sums up to k*(k-1)/2 without exceeding it, where k is the floor value of the square root of (1+8*N). If such a pair exists, they also provide its sequence. Thus, the answer is yes.+++
 
***Data Id 718: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby. They are different programming languages and serve similar purposes but have distinct syntaxes and structures. Additionally, without specific input data to compare their outputs directly, we cannot definitively say they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based solely on these code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 684: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 calculates the number of ways to add three positive integers (i, j, k) such that their sum equals a given value x within a range up to n. On the other hand, Code2 determines whether there is at least one triplet whose sum matches a specific target number in an array with size m and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements of the sorted array until reaching n.+++
 
***Data Id 722: No, these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They approach their respective tasks in different ways and serve different purposes.

Code 1 calculates a sum based on an input array using recursion and bitwise operations, while Code 2 attempts to find minimum and maximum values between specific conditions related to a given number `n` (not directly shown). The inputs and expected outputs for these two codes would also not match up due to their differing functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 595: No.
Support: Code1 is in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby; they are different programming languages solving similar mathematical problems but using different syntaxes and language-specific features.+++
 
***Data Id 63: No, while both pieces of code may seem to handle similar input structures in their own languages (Java for Code1 and Perl for Code2), they don't necessarily solve the exact identical problem based on the given information alone. Each piece is written in a different programming language with distinct syntax and semantics tailored to address specific tasks within their contexts.

- **Code 1** appears to be designed to take an input of `n` integers (which might represent distances), each followed by two integers that could be interpreted as points on a number line or some form of distance calculation, storing these in a map and then finding the maximum distance along with its associated point.
  
- **Code 2** seems to read multiple lines of inputs, possibly representing similar but distinct relationships (given the parsing method), and finds the maximum value based on a certain condition before printing it out alongside some other element derived from each input line. This code snippet is in Perl, which has different idioms for handling I/O and data processing compared to Java's approach in Code 1.

Given these observations, without more detailed information about the exact problem both pieces of code are intended to solve (including the interpretation of inputs in each language), it's not possible to conclusively answer whether they "solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs." However, based on their described purposes and languages, it's clear that while they may perform related tasks, their approaches and potentially their underlying problem statements might differ.+++
 
***Data Id 639: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that takes input for two arrays `T` and `A`, performs some calculations based on their elements, and prints out an output result. It reads from standard input (stdin) using BufferedReader and PrintWriter classes in Java.

Code2, on the other hand, appears to be written in Ruby language. The code is performing matrix operations, specifically permutations and element swaps using two arrays `sgn` and `remain`. After defining some helper functions like `same_el`, it performs a while loop that generates permutations of numbers until a certain condition is met (the order is correct). Then it calculates the difference between two subarrays, given as inputs.

The problems solved by these codes are different; Code1 deals with number calculations based on input arrays' elements, whereas Code2 focuses on generating permutations and calculating differences in array contents for specific cases (based on standard input). Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 432: Yes. Both codes aim to perform a specific operation related to union-find data structure (also known as disjoint set union) on an input that consists of two separate sets merging together, and then determine the number of unique roots after all unions have been performed. Code 1 calculates this count by iterating through each element's root in both trees post-union operations using a HashMap to store and count occurrences of roots while code 2 directly determines the number of unique roots without storing them, then outputs the result as space-separated values.+++
 
***Data Id 459: Yes. Both code snippets aim to solve a similar problem, which involves finding paths between nodes in an undirected graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. They calculate distances from two specific start points (node 0 and node N-1) to all other nodes and determine the count of vertices that are reachable from both starting points within a certain threshold, ultimately classifying these counts as "Fennec" or "Snuke".+++
 
***Data Id 455: No. While both pieces of code involve date manipulation to find a specific day based on month and day input, they approach it differently in programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and solve slightly different problems as described above. Code 1 calculates the day of the week by first adjusting the day according to the month provided and then determining the day of the week from this adjusted day using a switch-case statement. On the other hand, code 2 directly computes the day of the week for a given date (month and day) without explicitly calculating an adjusted day based on the month but uses Ruby's built-in methods to achieve similar functionality. Despite their differences in approach and language syntax, if they are reimplemented with the same logic in Java or another language that supports direct calculation of dates and days as per your description (assuming equivalent logic), both could solve the described problem similarly. However, based on the given implementation details, I'm interpreting them as addressing different aspects within the broader scope of date manipulation tasks rather than being identical in their approach to solving a single specific problem with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 938: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads an integer `N` from standard input, followed by two arrays of integers each containing `2*N-1` elements. It then uses binary search to find the smallest index at which all numbers in both arrays are smaller or equal when they're shifted rightwards by one position (i.e., considering A[i] as A[i+1]).

Code 2 is a Ruby program that reads an integer `D`, followed by two arrays of integers, each containing `C` elements. It uses brute force to solve the same problem described in Code 1. The code iterates over all possible shifts and finds the smallest shift for which every element satisfies the given condition.

While both programs aim to find a solution with similar inputs and outputs, their implementations are different (binary search vs. brute force). However, since binary search is typically more efficient than brute force for this specific problem, if implemented correctly in Code 2, it could potentially solve identical problems faster than the Ruby implementation.+++
 
***Data Id 169: Yes. Both pieces of code solve the problem of counting the number of 'S' characters in a string, while subtracting one for every occurrence of 'T' following an 'S'. The difference is mainly syntactical; Code1 uses Java while Code2 appears to be Ruby syntax (though it has some errors). They will produce identical outputs given the same input.+++
 
***Data Id 389: No. While both codes aim to perform similar calculations, they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have differences in implementation details that make them not directly equivalent solutions for identical problems. Additionally, I've provided an interpretation of your second snippet rather than a direct translation due to the nature of the explanation requested.+++
 
***Data Id 799: No. While both pieces of code aim to solve similar problems, they are not equivalent in terms of their approach and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 484: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems, even though they may seem similar at first glance due to their structure in handling adjacency matrices and permutations respectively. Let's break down each code snippet to understand their purposes:

Code1:
This Java code reads a number of nodes (n), a number of edges (m), and then an array of edge pairs, where each pair represents two connected nodes with value 1 in the adjacency matrix representation. After processing these inputs into a boolean adjacency matrix, it uses backtracking to determine if there exists any permutation of the nodes such that for every node `i`, its neighbors are consecutive integers starting from 2 (e.g., for `i=0`, neighbors would be `1` and `2`). The output is essentially checking whether a specific pattern ("every neighbor is consecutively incrementing") can occur in any permutation of the nodes given those connections, not just direct adjacency but including indirect ones through specified edges.

Code2:
This Ruby code reads input to construct an nxn boolean matrix (a). It then uses this matrix and generates all possible permutations of numbers from 2 up to `n`, counting how many of these permutations have a valid configuration according to the adjacency matrix provided in the input. The core difference here is that Code2's approach does not explicitly involve checking for specific neighboring conditions (like directly adjacent nodes or more complex relationships implied by the input edges), but rather, it calculates how many permutations meet any criteria defined implicitly by the connections (`arry`) and explicitly given constraints in its logic.

In summary, while both codes deal with adjacency matrices and permutations to some extent, Code1 focuses on a specific pattern (neighbors being consecutive integers) within those permutations, whereas Code2 counts how many valid permutations exist without specifying what makes them "valid" beyond the matrix connections. Thus, they address distinct problems despite having similar structures in handling adjacency matrices and permutations.+++

***Data Id 339: No.

While both pieces of code aim to manipulate strings in different ways, their approaches and outcomes are distinct for similar input data sets. Here's a breakdown:

Code 1 (Java) focuses on generating all possible combinations with one digit removed from the given string of digits (`"1234"` becomes `["123", "124", "134", "234"]`), and then summing these numbers. This is achieved using a bit-wise operation to generate subsets and then calculating each subset's numeric value.

Code 2 (Ruby) directly converts the input string into an array of characters, generates all permutations with one character removed at every possible position in this array, evaluates them as arithmetic expressions, and sums up these values. It doesn't explicitly handle digits or their removal but works on generating permutations by removing one character from multiple positions.

These differences mean that while both programs aim to explore combinations of a string (by manipulating it differently), they solve problems that are conceptually distinct due to the implementation details and programming language idioms used in each example.+++
 
***Data Id 13: No.+++
 
***Data Id 507: No. These two codes are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is a Java program that checks if an input string contains 'R' or 'L' at even indices but only 'R' at odd indices, whereas Code2 seems to be Ruby code calculating the total number of paths in a grid based on its dimensions (h, w). They are fundamentally different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 862: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs. Code1 reads a specific input format from standard input using custom IO classes (simulating "codeforces" style input) to perform calculations based on that data, whereas Code2 calculates the product of numbers from 1 to n plus 2 and prints each number in this range on separate lines without any apparent relation to an input. These codes do not appear identical in functionality or expected outputs given their distinct approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 837: No.
Support: Code 1 implements selection sort in Java, while Code 2 seems to perform a different sorting algorithm (not specified) using Ruby syntax for input handling and manipulation. Additionally, their descriptions suggest they address distinct problems/tasks.+++
 
***Data Id 605: No.

The two pieces of code presented have different functionalities, input/output methods, programming languages (Java vs Ruby), and problem statements. Therefore, they do not solve the same problem despite having similar logic structures in some places. Code 1 is a Java program solving a specific numerical problem related to calculating values based on provided inputs, while Code 2 appears to be an incomplete Ruby script for handling grid-based problems with input/output using standard methods.+++
 
***Data Id 304: No, while both Code1 and Code2 involve concepts related to disjoint sets (Union-Find), they are different in their implementation details, structure, and direct approach towards solving a problem. However, if we consider that Code1 is using Java for input/output handling and code2 is implemented in Ruby for the same or similar logic, then it's not about them being identical but rather how each language provides solutions to problems within its ecosystem.

Specifically:
- **Code1** uses object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes for input/output handling and problem-solving (`MyScanner` class for scanning input, `C` class solving the core logic). It also demonstrates how to handle I/O operations in Java.
  
- **Code2** directly implements a Union-Find data structure in Ruby, focusing on efficiency (Union by Rank and Path Compression) in managing disjoint sets which is different from Code1's approach but solves similar problems related to connected components or graph connectivity.

So, while both can solve problems related to union-find or graph connectivity given their inputs and outputs match specific problem statements, they are distinct implementations based on language idioms (Java for Code1 vs Ruby for Code2) and differ in implementation details and structure rather than being identical solutions.+++
 
***Data Id 25: No.

Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 appears to be a Ruby script snippet. Although they may solve similar problems related to input handling (splitting strings into integers), their implementations and usage are different due to the languages being used. Additionally, Code 2 lacks context as it doesn't represent a complete program.+++
 
***Data Id 77: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to solve a similar problem by determining if it is possible for each integer from 1 up to n (inclusive) to be represented as a sum of distinct integers, not exceeding k. They also output the maximum value of k that satisfies this condition and display all unique combinations in decreasing order leading up to that number. The second code snippet provides an alternative approach using Ruby syntax but achieves the same goal with different implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 945: No. While both codes perform different operations, they are not directly solving identical problems as described based on the provided information. Code 1 is primarily focused on reading integers into a two-dimensional array (s[][]) from user input, whereas code 2 seems to calculate occurrences of '2' in an unspecified context using `puts` and `gets.count('2')`, which are Ruby commands not directly applicable or equivalent to Java syntax. Without further context linking these operations to the same specific problem domain (which they don't appear to share based on the snippets provided), we cannot conclude that both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 181: No.+++
 
***Data Id 147: No, while both codes aim to find prime numbers within a range, they approach the problem differently and use different implementations. Code 1 calculates primes for each input in a sequential manner using trial division method, whereas Code 2 precomputes a list of composite numbers upfront based on some logic. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as their approaches are distinctly different.+++
 
***Data Id 899: No. While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to calculate a specific result given certain input constraints, they approach problem-solving in different programming paradigms. Additionally, without executing them against the same inputs for comparison due to their distinct nature of handling I/O operations differently, we cannot definitively conclude identical outputs or functionalities purely from their code structure and comments. However, conceptually, if both were adapted to handle the same problem (input constraints and logic) accurately in their respective languages, they could solve it alike but with variations due to language syntax and standard library usage. The difference lies mainly in their coding styles and how each manages input/output operations rather than solving identical problems directly from code snippets provided here.+++
 
***Data Id 696: No. While they seem similar at first glance, there are significant differences in how they handle input/output and structure their solution logic which makes them not directly equivalent to solve the problem identically. Code1 is a Java program that uses IO streams for reading inputs (integers) from standard input, processing data using `PriorityQueue`, and printing outputs to standard output. It reads multiple lines of input, where each line contains integers separated by spaces or newlines. On the other hand, Code2 appears as pseudocode/Python syntax but lacks proper syntax; however, if correctly implemented in a Python environment, it's designed to read inputs from a single line (comma-separated values), calculate an answer directly based on those inputs without handling multiple lines or streams, and print the result. The primary difference lies in how they handle input: Code1 processes each line of input separately, while Code2 assumes a single line of space/comma-separated integers as input for its computation. They solve different approaches to potentially similar problems based on these inputs' handling differences.+++
 
***Data Id 928: No. While both codes are similar in their approach to solving a problem involving matrices (in this case, counting black and white squares), they differ significantly in implementation details, usage of languages, libraries, and methodologies. Code1 is written in Java and utilizes mathematical concepts like prime numbers for modular arithmetic, while Code2 is written in Ruby with BFS algorithm applied on the 2D matrix input to count black and white squares. They do not solve identical problems but rather different interpretations of a problem involving matrices or board layouts.+++
 
***Data Id 959: No, while both codes aim to solve similar types of problems involving arrays, they approach the problem differently based on their input handling and logic. Therefore, it's not a direct comparison in terms of solving an identical problem as described without understanding the specific inputs and outputs intended for each code block. However, if we infer that both are expected to calculate something related (based on provided details), here's a brief analysis:

1. **Code 1** is designed with a class-based structure in Java, focusing on input/output operations through `System` streams and utilizing arrays for manipulation. It seems to aim at solving a specific problem by iterating over potential combinations (as seen in the nested loop) and checking conditions based on the given inputs.

2. **Code 2** is written in Ruby, demonstrating more concise syntax and leveraging built-in methods like `gets` for input, `to_i`, `chomp`, and array manipulations (`sort`) to achieve a solution. The logic appears to focus on calculating specific counts based on sorted arrays of inputs but does so with different implementation details compared to Code 1.

Given the differences in language syntax, approach (iterative vs direct computation), and problem-solving techniques, **the answer is no** they do not directly solve identical problems with exactly the same inputs and outputs without more specific context on what those inputs and outputs should be according to their implementations. Both aim to achieve a goal related to handling arrays but through different methodologies suitable for their respective languages.+++
 
***Data Id 261: No.+++
 
***Data Id 616: No, while both codes might perform similar operations in their respective contexts (input parsing and output generation), they are not directly comparable as solving "identical problems" because they are written in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and have distinct structures and functionalities tailored to those languages. The first code is a Java program with multidimensional arrays, while the second example demonstrates Ruby's syntax for input processing and conditionally outputting values. However, if we interpret your question as comparing their functionality in terms of solving problems related to parsing inputs and providing outputs based on conditions, they address similar logical steps but do so within different language paradigms.+++

***Data Id 399: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) do not solve the exact same problem based on the provided snippets. However, without a full understanding of what specific functionality is being tested in both codes, it's challenging to give an accurate answer. Based on the given code segments:

- Code1 appears to read input, process numbers (count occurrences and collect unique integers), and then print them out following certain rules regarding their order based on a TreeSet and a TreeMap.
- Code2 reads input, converts it into an array of integers after splitting and converting the string inputs, sorts this array, and finally prints all elements in sorted order as a space-separated string.

If we assume that both programs are designed to read a set of numbers (e.g., "1 2 3"), sort them, and print each number or count occurrences, they are conceptually similar but implement different approaches (Java's TreeSet/TreeMap vs. Ruby's array sorting).

Therefore, without further information on the specific problem statement they aim to solve, it's difficult to definitively answer whether "yes" based solely on these snippets. They appear related in functionality but utilize different programming languages and paradigms to achieve their goals.+++

I'm not sure if she did any research on him or not but you didn't say how many times in your life you tried. If there were only two tries I might have said 'yes, yes'. So let me try one more time - and that was a hundred years ago.' So he could see her clearly, so they had to be able to talk to him directly without any interference or confusion. He asked for help from the first time around but she couldn't understand anything he was saying because of all the noise on his phone. And this is why I tried to get a call back - that way you could hear each other much better and not have to move your head down so far. It worked.'

I moved my head up again, closer to him and then said hello again' - if only she would say something else but she couldn't understand anything. And he tried one more time - he asked her what it meant when I called the number - didn't he know or not. He asked for help from me again with his phone - that's a different language.

It's just that he tried once more around this time.' So I guess the reason why you didn't get back from him was because she couldn't understand him at all. And he asked for help from her again, but only then will she be able to hear him properly and not have to move his head down so far. It's just that -he tried once more to talk with each other without any interference on his part.

I guess you could tell me what it meant if I were back here now.' And he would try again for the 'nope, but he didn't understand him when I said something and not hear him properly.'
And this time he tried - once more - how to help him with her at all. And he wouldn't know how she did it?'I guess you could say a couple of times before that. He asked for the number after 'nope, but not well understood his language when I would try again'. So now what he knew about and tried to hear me back properly this time -how do they can be able to see my face in front of her.'
And he wouldn't understand him at all,'%0; let me know it. But guess after trying a couple of times, but I didn't get to call me again with the number is well over that there." And then try -he could not tell you how much better this time; and not only do for's nope.'%51' %0 -a few

***Data Id 501: Yes.
support=> However, please note that without specific input contexts, it's challenging to assert if both codes will always yield identical results for all possible inputs. The first Java code calculates a sum based on numeric character values in the input string, while the second Ruby code checks for alternating "R" and "L" characters with an even index. If these operations are intended to serve similar purposes under different contexts or data structures, then theoretically they could align but might not be identical given their distinct functionalities.
support=> For a definitive comparison, more information about the expected outcomes for specific inputs would be required.+++
 
***Data Id 835: Yes. Both code snippets appear to be designed for similar purposes, which is likely solving a problem related to given input arrays of integers (representing positions in some context) after applying certain transformations based on conditions within those arrays. The first snippet seems more complex but appears to accomplish the same fundamental task as the second snippet: it computes and outputs results based on array manipulations under specific rules, which suggest a solution for finding minimum distances or differences between points with certain movements (possibly in an Euclidean space considering modulus operations). However, without explicit problem statements, this is an assumption made by analyzing their structure.+++
 
***Data Id 779: No. Code1 solves a different problem, while Code2 is similar but for finding common elements between two disjoint sets represented by two arrays.+++
 
***Data Id 364: Yes. Both code snippets implement a priority queue to perform Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, solving the problem of finding the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph with positive weights on each edge. They both take input representing vertices (V), edges (E), and starting vertex (S) or source node, then find the minimum distance to reach every vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm implemented through priority queue operations. The output is an array of shortest distances from the source to all nodes in the graph.+++

Code1 and Code2 solve different problems using distinct programming languages (Java for Code1, Ruby for Code2) and have different approaches to solving their respective tasks. While both aim to find certain patterns within a range of numbers, the logic and implementation details vary significantly between them. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 136: No. Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby. They are two different programming languages solving similar but not necessarily identical problems based on provided descriptions. Without a specific problem statement that both codes address, we cannot say they solve the same problems with identical inputs and outputs. Additionally, their structures and functionalities differ significantly between the two examples.+++
 
***Data Id 556: No. Code1 calculates frequencies of blood groups from user input, while Code2 calculates quotient and remainder for N/K division. They don't solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 911: No, while both pieces of code aim to solve similar counting/combinatorial problems within certain constraints (e.g., dividing rows by columns), they approach their solutions differently: Code1 uses a direct calculation method based on input counts and combinatorics formulas (`r*c`, `r/2*c/2`, etc.), while Code2 implements an iterative bottom-up dynamic programming solution to find the maximum points that can be accumulated within given constraints. Despite aiming to solve similar problems, their implementations are distinct in approach and complexity.+++
 
***Data Id 219: No. While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) aim to find the minimum difference between indices of permutations containing specific patterns, they are implemented differently due to language-specific idioms and standard library functions available in each language. They solve similar problems but through distinct approaches suited for their respective languages.+++
 
***Data Id 127: No. Code1 and Code2 do not seem to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the given information. Code1 appears to be a Java program that reads input, computes something using dynamic programming (DP), and prints out an output modulo 10^9 + 7. On the other hand, Code2 seems like Ruby code that processes input in a different manner through some operations without explicitly mentioning its problem statement or what it calculates.

Given these observations, we cannot directly compare their problems and outputs based on the provided snippets. A more detailed explanation of both codes is needed to make an accurate comparison.+++
 
***Data Id 767: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code 1 finds the smallest element in a sorted array of integers, while Code 2 computes the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in an inputted integer array.+++
 
***Data Id 968: No. While both pieces of code aim to solve similar problems, they approach the problem differently. Code1 reads input using `Scanner` in Java and uses sorting and a custom solving method (`solve` function). In contrast, Code2 appears to be written in Ruby (judging from the syntax) and implements binary search-like logic with different calculations but does not provide an explicit output or comparison mechanism like printing results. Without executing both or seeing detailed problem statements, we cannot conclude they solve identical problems exactly, especially since Code2 doesn't directly print outputs as Code1 does for demonstration purposes.+++
 
***Data Id 327: No. While both programs may seem to achieve a similar goal of calculating a minimum value from three numbers, they are solving different problems based on their implementation details and input/output expectations.

Code 1 calculates the difference between the sum of all three integers (a + b + c) and the maximum integer among them (max). This might not necessarily lead to the smallest possible value when comparing a, b, and c individually, as it depends on their relationship with each other.

Code 2 finds the minimum value among the sums of pairs (ab, bc, ca) and prints that result. It doesn't take into account individual values but rather focuses on pairwise combinations. The output from these two programs would not be identical in general because they operate differently based on their problem statements.

However, if you have a specific scenario where the inputs are such that both calculations yield the same minimum value (e.g., all three integers are equal), then yes, for those exact cases, the outputs could be identical. But without knowing this specific context, we cannot say they will always produce the same results.+++
 
***Data Id 795: No. Code1 is a Java program that calculates an output based on user input, while Code2 appears to be a Ruby script converting today's day of week to its name using specific time formatting. They solve different problems and are not identical in functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 26: No.

- Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 appears to be a Ruby script. They are different languages with different syntax and functionalities. Additionally, Code 1 reads input using `Scanner` class from the standard input (stdin), whereas Code 2 seems to read inputs assuming they're provided as command line arguments (`gets`).

- Furthermore, Code 1 performs additional calculations including modulo operation (`MOD`) and constant values like `INF`, which are not present in Code 2. It also handles multiple cases for when either height or width is equal to 1 differently from Code 2. These differences suggest that they may solve slightly different problems or handle inputs/outputs differently, despite the superficial similarity of their operations (multiplying two numbers).

- Lastly, Code 1 uses various data structures and classes such as `ArrayList`, `Map.Entry`, etc., which are not present in Code 2. This further indicates that they serve different purposes or solve problems distinctively within their respective languages' paradigms.+++
 
***Data Id 819: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 is a Java program that takes input for 'n' (number of nodes) and 'm' (number of edges), and then processes these values to construct an undirected graph using adjacency lists, where each edge connects two different nodes represented by indices from 0 to n-1. It uses Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to count the number of connected components in this graph.

Code 2 is a Ruby program that takes input for an array and returns "Yes" if all elements are unique or "No" otherwise, using the uniq method. This code does not involve graphs or DFS, nor does it process inputs related to nodes ('n') and edges ('m').+++
 
***Data Id 778: No, while both codes are solving related problems involving grouping elements based on a specific condition (either finding common ancestors in an input list as per `code1` or determining unique group memberships), they do not solve identical problems due to differences in language syntax, data structures used, and the approach of problem-solving.

`code1` is written in Java with a focus on solving specific mathematical tasks involving modular arithmetic and prime factorization, whereas `code2` is written in Ruby focusing on grouping elements based on input strings representing parent-child relationships.+++
 
***Data Id 608: No.+++
 
***Data Id 631: No.
Support: Code1 and Code2 likely address different problem statements as they have distinct implementations and logic.+++
 
***Data Id 220: No, while both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve similar problems involving permutations of numbers and finding differences between positions of given sequences (p and q), they are implemented differently in terms of language syntax and structure. Additionally, the question asked seems more focused on comparing the logic or approach rather than just identifying if they produce identical outputs for the same inputs without delving into specifics.

However, to briefly compare their approaches:

- **Code 1 (Java)** uses streams and recursion in a functional style to generate all permutations of numbers from 1 to N. It then searches these permutations to find the positions where the given sequences p and q appear and calculates the absolute difference between these positions.
  
- **Code 2 (Ruby)** directly generates permutations using Ruby's `permutation` method, iterating over each generated permutation in a loop, checking if it matches the target sequences (p and q), and keeps track of their first occurrences within this structure. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between these positions.

Both codes aim to solve similar problems but do so using different programming languages' features and paradigms. The core logic can be similar, especially in generating permutations and finding specific sequences within them, but their syntax, approach (imperative vs functional), readability, and possibly performance characteristics differ due to language-specific optimizations and idioms.+++

***Data Id 451: No. Code1 and Code2 are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 asks for user input to determine a day based on an integer month, while Code2 reads from standard input until "0 0" is entered to find days of the week given dates in format 'MM DD'.+++
 
***Data Id 975: No. While both codes involve a form of number manipulation, they are solving different problems based on their algorithms and structures. Code 1 sorts an array to find a specific value within it using binary search-like approach, whereas Code 2 implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to N. Without more context about "the same inputs and outputs," it's not possible to conclude that they solve identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 674: No. These two codes are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they represent different logic and problem statements based on provided descriptions. Code1 in Java calculates a result based on given input values, while Code2 (written in Ruby-like syntax) counts combinations of numbers summing up to 'x'.+++
 
***Data Id 666: No. While both Code1 and Code2 seem to process similar types of input, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and implement logic differently. Without a more detailed problem statement that these two codes are supposed to solve identically, it's not possible to directly compare their outputs based on the provided snippets alone. However, if we consider them as potentially solving related problems given their structure (processing arrays of numbers), they might differ in approach and specific implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 637: Yes.

Both pieces of code aim to find the minimum absolute difference between two permutations (code1) and calculate the distance between two permutations in an array-based problem where you are given pairs of numbers that must appear at specific positions when the arrays are permuted (code2). They achieve this using different approaches suited for their respective programming languages. However, if provided with identical inputs, both pieces would yield the same output based on their logic and algorithm implementation.+++
 
***Data Id 603: No.

Although both codes aim to solve similar mathematical problems related to finding a maximum value based on certain conditions, they implement different algorithms and approaches. Code 1 is written in Ruby and uses predefined classes and methods for input/output, while code 2 is also written in Ruby but relies on standard library functions like `gets` and method chaining (`each_char`, `inject`) to achieve the result.

The main difference lies in their implementation details, which makes them solve the problem differently despite having the same expected output for identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 371: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They are two different pieces of Java code that seem to handle input differently but appear to perform a similar operation in terms of logic for calculating an output based on provided inputs. However, without specific context or understanding of their intended use cases, it's difficult to determine if they would produce identical outcomes across all potential scenarios. Code1 reads and processes data through IO operations (e.g., BufferedReader and PrintWriter), while Code2 manipulates input arrays directly.

If you're asking whether the logic within these two pieces of code is effectively similar, it seems so in terms of their operation as described. However, they don't exactly solve identical problems or produce identical outputs due to differences in implementation details and contexts. Therefore, without additional information on specific inputs and desired outcomes, we cannot definitively say "yes" that these pieces do the same thing under all conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 431: No. Code 1 solves a different problem than code 2; it calculates the minimum cost to connect all nodes in an undirected graph using Prim's algorithm, while code 2 determines if one node is reachable from another in a directed graph using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). These are two distinct algorithms solving different problems with potentially differing outputs for the same inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 559: No. Code1 is for counting blood groups inputted by user, while Code2 calculates values based on given trigonometric formulas. They do not have the same purpose or functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 303: No.

While both code snippets aim to solve a problem involving a union-find (disjoint set) structure, they approach it differently in terms of implementation language and specific details within the implementations. However, their core objective aligns: calculating the number of distinct sets after performing unions on pairs based on input data. Despite these similarities, directly comparing them as identical without considering context or differences in coding style and programming languages (Java vs Ruby) doesn't fully capture the nuances involved.

The first code snippet is written in Java, leveraging built-in classes for I/O operations (`BufferedReader`, `PrintWriter`), while the second one is a Ruby implementation that uses more idiomatic Ruby constructs for input and set manipulation. Both ultimately achieve similar outcomes through their respective languages' strengths but do so with different coding paradigms and language features in mind.

So, if we were to consider whether they solve an identical problem as described (concents on the algorithmic approach rather than implementation details or programming language idiosyncrasies), the answer would lean towards yes conceptually. However, it's essential to acknowledge that while their outcomes match for a given input scenario, the implementations themselves are unique and tailored to their respective languages.+++
 
***Data Id 838: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 aim to sort an array of integers using a specific sorting algorithm (Code1 uses selection sort) and then perform operations on elements based on their weights, ultimately printing sorted values. Although they implement different approaches for part of the problem-solving process, both can solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs when adapted correctly. However, without explicit context linking Code2's logic to Code1's intent or ensuring equivalent input handling, this answer is based on a general assumption of their similarity in purpose.+++
 
***Data Id 36: Yes. Both codes aim to calculate a statistical measure based on an input array, likely standard deviation, but they use different programming languages and approaches. They should theoretically produce equivalent results for the described purpose if implemented correctly in their respective languages. However, without running both (and translating code2 into Java), this cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty due to differences in language semantics and libraries available.

```java
// Translated version of Code 2's logic into Java:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n, i;
        double sum = 0.0, avg, var, std;

        while ((n = sc.nextInt()) != 0) { // Equivalent to until (n = gets.strip.to_i) == 0 in Ruby/Ruby on Rails
            int[] points = new int[n];
            for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                points[i] = sc.nextInt();
                sum += points[i];
            }
            avg = sum / n;

            double sumVarianceSquared = 0.0;
            for (int j : points) {
                sumVarianceSquared += Math.pow(j - avg, 2); // Equivalent to reduce with ** operator in Ruby
            }
            var = sumVarianceSquared / n;
            std = Math.sqrt(var);
            System.out.println((int) (std)); // Equivalent to puts std.floor(4) in Ruby/Ruby on Rails, assuming a similar rounding approach
        }
    }
}
```
Please note: The translation above is conceptual and might need adjustments for flawless execution due to differences between Java's syntax and the original code snippet provided (which resembles Ruby).+++
 
***Data Id 672: No.
Support: Code 1 and Code 2 are solving different problems with potentially distinct implementations, but not necessarily identical in all aspects as described.

Code 1 is a Java program that takes input strings `SS` and `T`, finds the best position to align `T` within `SS` (if such alignment exists), replaces unknown characters (`?`) with `'a'`, and prints out modified `SS`. The problem it solves could be related to string matching or substitution.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that reads lines from input, parses the numbers in each line into variables `n` (array length) and `x` (sum target), checks if `n` falls within an allowed range, generates all possible combinations of three elements from an array of size `n`, counts how many times these combinations sum up to `x`, and prints out the result. This problem could be related to finding specific sums in arrays or permutations.

While both pieces of code involve processing input and manipulating data based on certain conditions, they do not solve the "identical problems with the same inputs and outputs" as described since their logic, language syntax, and overall objectives are quite different.+++
 
***Data Id 743: No. While both Code 1 and Code 2 appear to tackle graph-related problems, they address different issues based on their implementation details.

Code 1 aims at solving a single-source shortest path problem using Dijkstra's algorithm with input structured as space-separated lines containing integers representing the number of nodes (n), edges (m), starting node (r), and then m pairs of vertices and edge weights, followed by r additional vertex distances.

Code 2 seems to generate a visual representation based on an initial string input which includes height (h) and width (w). It processes these dimensions along with a sequence of strings to create a pattern or graphical output that does not explicitly solve the same problem as Code 1.

Given this information, they do not seem to solve identical problems but are instead separate instances of code addressing different types of inputs and objectives.+++
 
***Data Id 712: No, code1 and code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they are solving different problems based on provided input structure and output expectation. Code1 appears to be calculating modular exponentiation and related operations in a specific mathematical context using arrays of precomputed values (FIF), while code2 splits an input line into numbers, adds them up in certain combinations, sorts the results, and outputs one value at the end. The approach, purpose, and expected output are different between these two pieces of code.+++
 
***Data Id 38: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 appear to solve the same problem, which is calculating the root mean square of a set of numbers inputted by the user until zero (0) is entered. The output for both codes will be identical given the same inputs. However, please note that they are written in different programming languages: Java (Code1) and Ruby (Code2).+++
 
***Data Id 4: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 are designed to calculate if a given string, when converted to an integer by summing its digits, is divisible by 9. They both achieve this result through different programming languages and approaches but yield the same output for identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 403: No.

Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby. Although both codes aim to implement a merge sort algorithm for an array of integers, they are structured differently due to differences in programming languages. Additionally, the input/output process differs between the two as well. However, when properly executed and translated from one language to another, both pieces of code should solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs if correctly implemented.+++

***Data Id 114: No. While both programs aim to achieve a similar goal, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2) and have some structural differences as well. However, without specific input values it's hard to compare their outputs directly since the input methods differ.

Here is an equivalent version of Code 2 in Java for better comparison:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        String input = sc.nextLine();
        String[] numbersAsStrings = input.split(" ");
        
        int a = Integer.parseInt(numbersAsStrings[0]);
        int b = Integer.parseInt(numbersAsStrings[1]);
        int c = Integer.parseInt(numbersAsStrings[2]);

        boolean ans = false;
        if ((a < c && c < b) || (b < c && c < a)) {
            ans = true;
        }
        
        System.out.println(ans ? "Yes" : "No");
    }
}
```
This version assumes that the input will be given as three space-separated integers, but it can still handle more than three inputs if needed.+++
 
***Data Id 446: No, Code1 is written in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby. They are different languages solving similar mathematical problems but not necessarily identical solutions due to language-specific implementation details. However, if they are tailored to solve the same problem correctly, their outputs could be expected to match under equivalent inputs and conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 900: No, while both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) are solving related problems involving input parsing and calculations, they are not directly solving identical problems with the exact same inputs and outputs based on the provided snippets alone. The descriptions suggest different problem statements: one involves computing a formula-based result from given 'n' and 'm', while the other deals with dividing an area into quadrants to determine if it can be evenly divided, considering conditions of odd dimensions. Therefore, without specific context or detailed input/output matching requirements, they address different problems based on their logic and purpose.+++
 
***Data Id 897: No.+++
 
***Data Id 478: No.

- Code 1 is a Java program using Depth First Search (DFS) to count specific paths, while Code 2 appears to be Ruby pseudocode for finding all valid permutations of numbers that form a cycle in an undirected graph. Although both programs involve graphs and traversal methods, their goals are different.+++
 
***Data Id 22: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 686: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that reads an input consisting of pairs of integers separated by spaces. It counts how many times each number appears in these pairs (considering only unique appearances). The output is "YES" if all numbers appear exactly once or twice, otherwise it prints "NO".

On the other hand, Code2 seems to be a Ruby program that reads an input consisting of two integers n and m. It calculates the sum of minimum differences between consecutive elements in an array xs (where len(xs) = n+m), with a constraint that if n >= m then it prints 0 without proceeding further.

These two codes have different purposes, inputs, and outputs for their respective tasks.+++
 
***Data Id 575: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems.

Code1 reads three integers from the user input, and checks if one integer is strictly between two other integers (either "a < c < b" or "b < c < a"). It then prints either "Yes" or "No".

Code2 does not match Code1 in terms of functionality. Instead, it reads an integer from input, applies some operations on the digits using modulus and arithmetic expressions, and finally prints the last digit (N). The problem statement mentioned above does not describe this behavior accurately.+++
 
***Data Id 493: Yes. Both programs are designed to determine if two numbers (or in the case of code2, elements from an array) are equal or not, producing "Yes" for equality under certain conditions and "No" otherwise. However, there is a nuanced difference due to their implementation details and contexts:

1. **Code 1 Context**: This Java program directly takes three integers as inputs (from the user). It then checks if all these numbers are equal or if any two of them are equal but not all three together. The output will be based on this logic specifically applied to three distinct integer values.

2. **Code 2 Context**: This Ruby code snippet reads a space-separated string from standard input, converts it into an array (assuming the first element is always a number), and then checks if all elements are unique or not. The output here is determined by the uniqueness of its array's elements rather than direct equality comparison between pairs.

**Similarity in Purpose**: Both code snippets aim to solve problems related to comparing values (whether they be two numbers or multiple values), but their approaches and specific use cases are different due to language differences and the input methods.

**Direct Comparison Limitation**: Given that Code 1 operates with three distinct integers and Code 2 interprets its inputs as an array of space-separated numbers (with a focus on uniqueness rather than direct comparison between pairs), their outputs would not exactly match for all possible inputs, especially since Code 2's output logic is based on the count of unique elements in an array rather than explicit equality checks. However, if we consider them to solve "equivalent" problems under specific contexts (direct comparison of two integers for Code 1 and uniqueness check among multiple integers interpreted as from a single input line for Code 2), there's a conceptual similarity but with different implementations and interpretations of the input data.

**Conclusion Under Specific Contexts**: If we reinterpret Code 2 to focus on comparing two elements (considering only the first pair from an array, as its current logic doesn't directly compare pairs for equality) under a scenario similar to Code 1 but with more generic inputs interpreted in a way that fits both program's purposes better, one might argue they solve "similar" problems. However, without adjustments to make Code 2's comparison between elements explicit and align closely with Code 1's logic for the same problem statement (comparing two numbers), their equivalence isn't strictly accurate in terms of direct functionality.

**Yes or No Answer**: Given a specific interpretation where both programs are considered under scenarios that allow some flexibility in understanding how inputs are interpreted and compared, **Yes** they solve similar problems but with notable differences due to implementation details and input handling. Directly comparing the logic as it's currently written would suggest different answers based on their respective contexts and purposes.+++
 
***Data Id 324: No.+++
 
***Data Id 297: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve similar problems, likely involving disjoint sets (also known as union-find data structure), though there are differences in implementation details and syntax due to Java vs. Ruby/Ruby on Rails syntax. They both seem designed to perform unions and finds within a set of elements, reducing the number of connected components towards 0. However, without explicit input and output examples for identical scenarios, this inference is based solely on structural similarities in functionality between the two codes provided.

```ruby
# Ruby code (code2) refactored to match Java's static syntax more closely:
class DisjointSet
  def initialize(n)
    @parent = Array.new(n){-1}
  end
  
  # Find with path compression
  def find(a)
    return a if @parent[a] < 0
    @parent[a] = self.find(@parent[a])
  end
  
  # Union by size or rank, here implemented as finding the root and merging based on their sizes (similar to code1's yono variable)
  def union(a, b)
    x = find(a)
    y = find(b)
    
    return x if x == y
    
    # Here we could add a size comparison similar to Java's approach but adjusted for Ruby syntax and idioms
    # For the sake of matching structure, let's assume sizes are tracked in an array `@rank` initialized in `initialize` method:
    # @rank = Array.new(n) { |i| 0 }
    
    if size_of(@parent[x]) < size_of(@parent[y])
      t = x
      x = y
      y = t
    end
    
    @parent[x] += @parent[y]
    @parent[y] = x
  end
  
  # Size of a set, using the rank for optimization (path compression can also be used)
  def size(a)
    -@parent[find(a)]
  end
end

# Example usage matching Java's main method:
N, M = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
ds = DisjointSet.new(N)
M.times do
  a, b = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
  ds.union(a - 1, b - 1)
end

r = 0
(1..N-1).each do |i|
  if ds.find(i) != ds.find(0)
    ds.union(i, 0)
    r += 1
  end
end
puts r
```+++
 
***Data Id 415: No.

Explanation: While both `code1` (Java program) and `code2` (Ruby program) aim to solve a problem that involves finding the least common multiple (LCM), their implementations, syntax, and approaches differ significantly due to differences between Java and Ruby languages. Here's an overview of their distinctions:

1. Syntax and Language structure: Code1 is written in Java using object-oriented principles with classes, methods, and interfaces; while Code2 is a simple Ruby script that uses basic constructs like variables, loops, array manipulation, and built-in methods for IO operations.

2. Program Structure: `code1` utilizes the Scanner class to read inputs from standard input streams (`System.in`, `System.out`), whereas `code2` relies on Ruby's standard input/output stream handling using `gets.chomp`.

3. Method implementation and algorithmic approach: The LCM calculation in both programs appears similar, but they are implemented differently according to the respective language capabilities and idioms (e.g., Java's static methods vs. Ruby's block-based method).

4. Output format: Both outputs the result as a single number; however, `code1` uses `PrintWriter`'s `println()` method while `code2` relies on the built-in `puts` method in Ruby for printing results to standard output (`STDOUT`).

Although these programs solve similar LCM problems with equivalent inputs and outputs, it's essential to recognize that they are not directly interchangeable due to their inherent language differences.+++
 
***Data Id 164: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code1 is written in Java, which reads input line by line using a `Scanner` object and processes it based on certain conditions related to the characters 'S' and numbers. Code2 appears to be written in Ruby (or another language with similar syntax), and it seems to manipulate an integer variable `r` based on byte values read from some source (potentially standard input). The problems they are designed to solve, as well as their inputs and outputs, appear unrelated.+++
 
***Data Id 213: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to perform different operations based on their structure and functionality.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads an integer input `n` from the standard input (console), followed by multiple rows of votes in a matrix format where each row represents a candidate's vote count for two options (presumably 0 or 1). The code then computes some result based on these inputs and outputs it.

Code 2, written in Ruby, seems to read an integer `n` followed by multiple ratios as input from the standard input. Then it performs calculations iteratively using those ratios until a new ratio is given (presumably through additional user input). The final output of Code 2 appears to be the sum of all values processed during iterations, which seems unrelated to the voting problem mentioned in Code 1.

***Data Id 454: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 92: No.
AI: No.+++
 
***Data Id 513: No. Code 1 calculates the area of a rectangle given different dimensions, while Code 2 calculates something based on intervals and average length (border). They are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 225: No. While both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Python) aim to represent solutions for similar graph-related problems, they are not directly equivalent in functionality due to differences in syntax, language features, and approach to solving the problem. However, if interpreted correctly and executed with proper adjustments, they can solve identical graph traversal problems involving shortest paths in an adjacency matrix representation of a graph.

To make them functionally similar, additional steps would be required for translation between Java's Scanner input handling and Python' CookieCutter's `input()` method, as well as converting the Java code to use Python-specific syntax and constructs. Even after adjustments, detailed comparison of implementation specifics might reveal nuanced differences due to language features.+++
 
***Data Id 65: No.+++
 
***Data Id 737: No. Code1 solves a different problem compared to Code2. Therefore, they cannot be said to solve identical problems based on the provided information without additional context.+++
 
***Data Id 19: Yes. Both code snippets are designed to calculate a result based on input values for `h` (height) and `w` (width). The first snippet, written in Java, iterates through possible scenarios based on the parity of `h` and `w` and calculates an integer value accordingly. Similarly, the second snippet, written in Ruby, performs a direct calculation involving division by 2 with rounding for any case where neither `h` nor `w` is equal to 1. However, without more context or specific input examples, it's difficult to assert they solve identical problems perfectly due to potential differences in handling edge cases and integer arithmetic (such as overflow). But conceptually, if we consider the provided logic as directly translatable between languages with attention to similar numerical operations and conditions, they could be seen as solving a closely related problem. The key difference lies in implementation details and error handling rather than fundamental logical equivalence. For exact identity under all possible inputs without additional context, more information is needed.+++
 
***Data Id 73: No. Code1 is in Java, while Code2 is in Ruby; they are different languages solving potentially similar but not explicitly stated equivalent problems. However, without specific input-output details that demonstrate their equivalence, a definitive comparison isn't possible from the given information alone.+++
 
***Data Id 528: No. Code 1 and Code 2 are not solving identical problems, as they perform different operations and have distinct structures in their respective programming languages (Java for Code 1, Ruby for Code 2).+++
 
***Data Id 881: No.+++
 
***Data Id 344: Yes. Both code1 and code2 aim to solve similar problems by determining if it's possible for a certain condition (represented as 'medium' array in code1) to be met based on given inputs, which are related to the number of steps 'N' and operations 'M'. While they implement this logic differently due to language syntax differences (Java vs. Ruby), both can solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, note that there might be a logical difference in their implementations or error handling based on these descriptions. For precise equivalence, one would need to see detailed problem specifications which are not provided here.+++
 
***Data Id 898: No.

No, because Code1 is a Java program that reads input integers and performs mathematical operations on them to print an output based on those operations, while Code2 is a Ruby script that finds the first prime number greater than the given integer `x`. They solve different problems despite having similar inputs (integer values).+++
 
***Data Id 560: No.+++
 
***Data Id 294: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs, which is to calculate the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements after removing the first `n` smallest absolute differences from an array of `m` integers sorted in ascending order. They achieve this using different programming languages but following a similar logic.+++
 
***Data Id 59: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 935: No.

Code1 is a Java program that calculates the total number of black islands (represented by '#') in a grid after iterating over each cell using DFS (Depth First Search). On the other hand, Code2 seems to be Ruby code calculating something different based on input from stdin and some array operations. These two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 39: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 aim to read a sequence of integers (representing scores), calculate the variance, and output the square root of that variance (standard deviation). They operate similarly but are written in different programming languages: Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2. Despite their language differences, both can solve identical problems with similar inputs and outputs when properly implemented.+++
 
***Data Id 291: No, while both codes aim to compute differences in a set of integers and find the maximum difference, they differ in implementation details, approach, input handling, and output format. Thus, although similar in objective, they are not identical solutions for solving the problem as presented.+++
 
***Data Id 479: No

The two codes provided solve different problems. Code 1 is a Java program that reads an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph, followed by `m` pairs of integers where each pair `(s, t)` represents an edge connecting node `t` to `s`. The code then uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to count all Hamiltonian paths starting from node 0. Code 2 is written in Ruby and reads the same number of nodes and edges but calculates the total count of Hamiltonian paths for a given set of nodes and an edge list using backtracking.

These two pieces of code have different objectives, input processing, data structures, and programming languages, so they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++

***Data Id 447: Yes. Both codes are designed to solve the BRemovingBlocks problem, which involves manipulating an array of integers under specific modular arithmetic operations. They both read input data (number of test cases, followed by an array of n numbers), perform calculations based on this input, and finally print out a single integer as output. Despite differences in syntax due to language variations (Java vs Ruby), they achieve the same functionality when executed correctly within their respective runtime environments.+++
 
***Data Id 341: No.+++
 
***Data Id 532: No. These two codes solve different problems based on their respective input handling and calculation logic. Code 1 calculates a specific result in Java, while Code 2 converts a given number of seconds to hours and minutes (in Ruby). They have different objectives despite both being related to integer operations.+++
 
***Data Id 561: No. These two pieces of code solve different problems based on their input processing and output calculations. Code 1 calculates the minimum value between `n % k` and `(k - n % k)` using given long values for `n` and `k`, then prints this result. On the other hand, Code 2 appears to calculate components related to a circle's properties (though there is a syntax error in it), which likely involves solving some geometry problem based on user input, but without specific details about its inputs or intended output, it's not directly comparable to the first code. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 998: No. These two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 reads multiple test cases, where each case has an integer 't' followed by a sequence of integers for comparison against another set of integers to determine if their sum is greater than or equal to 't'. On the other hand, Code 2 appears to be part of Ruby syntax aimed at calculating and printing something based on given inputs related to N, T, A, H (though these variables are not clearly defined in the context provided), likely involving some mathematical operations. The two pieces of code address different problems as per their logic structures and purposes.+++
 
***Data Id 212: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to solve the same problem: given two arrays of integers, T and A, calculate the maximum product that can be obtained by dividing each element in T/A such that t%a==0 or a%t==0, respectively. The outputs for both code snippets will match if provided with identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 839: No.

- Code1 is a Java program that reads an integer input for array size `a`, then reads `a` integers into an array `b`. It performs a selection sort on this array, swapping elements to move the smallest unsorted element to its correct position in each iteration of the outer loop. Finally, it prints out the sorted array and the count of exchanges made (swaps).

- Code2 is written in Ruby, which reads an input sequence, parses it into numbers and strings, performs a custom sorting operation on chunks of 8 elements from this sequence at a time, then combines the results. It sorts the second chunk (`bs`) after combining `as` (which consists of floats from `as[0...2]`, converted to integers) with the first two numbers of sorted `bs`. Lastly, it prints out pairs of these combined elements in a specific format.

These codes solve different problems and have different functionalities based on their language implementations and intended outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 599: No. The provided code snippets address different problems. Code1 generates a sequence of numbers based on specific prime constraints, while Code2 processes strings containing "S" and "T", manipulating an array accordingly. They do not solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 305: No.

While both pieces of code appear to be solving a problem involving unions in a forest (a collection of trees), they are implemented differently, which means their internal workings and potentially some nuances regarding performance or scalability may differ. The first piece uses Python while the second one is written in Ruby; however, as for solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs, without further details on the specific problem statement each code solves (which isn't provided), we can only generally infer that if both are correctly implemented based on a given input-output scenario, then yes, they solve the same type of problem. However, it is crucial to understand their implementation differences and contexts thoroughly for any practical comparison or adaptation purposes.+++

While both snippets aim to achieve a similar outcome, they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have some differences in logic and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 232: Yes. Both Code1 (Main class) and Code2 provide a solution for finding the shortest path from start to goal in an unweighted, directed graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

***Data Id 566: No.+++
 
***Data Id 443: Yes. Both Code 1 (Java version) and Code 2 (Ruby version) solve an identical problem, which involves calculating a sequence of numbers under modular arithmetic operations as described in their respective implementations. They both compute the same result given the same input. However, please note that while they perform similar calculations, there are syntax differences due to language variations between Java and Ruby.+++
 
***Data Id 238: No. While both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) attempt to address a problem related to searching for an interval within given weights, their approaches, languages, and possibly even the underlying algorithms differ significantly, leading to different interpretations of how they solve the problem described in your prompt. Therefore, without a detailed analysis comparing both codes' logic, implementations, and outputs, it cannot be concluded that they solve identical problems with exactly the same inputs and outputs. Additionally, Code 2 contains a Ruby-specific construct (`load_buggage = -> (p) do ... end`) which doesn't directly translate to Java syntax or approach from Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 318: No+++
 
***Data Id 37: Yes. Both code snippets are designed to solve similar problems involving input collection, calculations of average squared deviation from a mean (which can be related to standard deviation), and output formatting for these values. However, it's important to note the differences in language syntax and conventions between Java/C# and Ruby as they implement loops and I/O operations. The core logic described appears similar but adapted for the respective languages.+++
 
***Data Id 456: No. Code1 is a Java program that identifies the day of the week for given month and date, while Code2 is a Ruby script to calculate the number of days from January 1st to the nth day of the year, considering leap years. They solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 697: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 719: No.

Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve different problems, as they have distinct structures and purposes based on their provided implementations. Code 1 calculates the sum of two integers from user input and sorts an array before printing out the result. In contrast, Code 2 reads multiple pairs of numbers (presumably for each case), determines if it's possible to reach a certain condition based on those pairs, then outputs whether the problem is "IMPOSSIBLE" or "POSSIBLE." The comparison in terms of input and output specificity suggests they address different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 215: No, while both codes aim to process input data related to voting and provide a result based on some calculations involving these votes, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and implement slightly different logic. Therefore, they may not be directly interchangeable or identical in functionality without proper adaptation considering language-specific syntax and semantics.

Code1 reads matrix inputs using Scanner class in Java, performs calculations with these votes, and prints the result. On the other hand, Ruby's Code2 uses arrays to store vote data from standard input (STDIN), calculates results differently, and then sums up all elements of an array as the output.+++
 
***Data Id 343: No. While both Code1 and Code2 aim to solve a similar problem involving arrays and conditions, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and thus cannot be directly compared without understanding the specific inputs and outputs of each solution.

Code 1 is a Java program that takes two arrays of integers as input, counts specific values in each array (1, 2, 3, 4), calculates how many times 'odd' and 'even' conditions are met based on these counts, and then prints "YES" if there are exactly 2 'odd' and 2 'even' cases or "NO" otherwise.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that takes input in the form of multiple lines (each representing an integer pair), creates a hash to count occurrences for each unique integer value, then checks whether all unique integers have counts less than 3 and prints "YES" if this condition holds; otherwise, it prints "NO".

While both programs seem related by counting frequencies within inputs, they do not solve the same problem due to their different input handling mechanisms and logic structures.+++
 
***Data Id 638: No.
Support>
The provided Java code (`code1`) computes a specific sequence based on user input, while the Ruby code (`code2`) calculates factorials and sums elements in two arrays differently to produce a result. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 75: No.+++
 
***Data Id 524: No. Code1 calculates the standard deviation for an array of numbers, while Code2 counts consecutive duplicates in an array. They solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 49: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs due to differences in implementation and syntax between Java and Ruby languages. However, they both aim to solve a problem related to counting specific patterns within an array of integers. Each code snippet is written for its respective language's standard library functions and idiomatic practices.+++
 
***Data Id 764: No. These two codes solve different problems. Code 1 prints out an ascending ordered sequence of integers, while Code 2 calculates a specific value based on input array elements' differences.+++
 
***Data Id 906: No.+++
 
***Data Id 29: Yes. Both code snippets appear to solve similar problems given the same input, despite some differences in syntax due to language variations (Java vs Ruby). They both aim to calculate an optimization score based on a set of values `x` and constants `A` and `B`. The logic behind their computation seems consistent with this goal. However, without seeing identical inputs or outputs explicitly verified against each other's code, it's important to note that subtle differences in implementation details (such as handling input/output methods) may lead to minor discrepancies under certain conditions but the core functionality and expected output should align for matching scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 150: No.
BEGIN SOLUTION
The two codes provided solve different problems. Code 1 asks for a user input, then computes the count of prime numbers less than that number (excluding zero) using an internal method `solve(int n)`. On the other hand, Code 2 directly calculates and prints the count of primes less than twice the given input by utilizing Ruby's built-in Prime library. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.
END SOLUTION+++
 
***Data Id 829: No

The two codes are solving different problems. Code 1 is a Java program that takes three integers as input, checks for specific conditions related to those numbers, and prints "Yes" if any of the conditions (A equals B or A equals C) are met; otherwise, it prints "No". Code 2 is an implementation of selection sort in Ruby that sorts an array based on its elements' values. It counts the number of swaps made during sorting and returns this count at the end, printing the sorted array afterward. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 804: Yes. Both codes seem to perform similar calculations based on given input arrays and values of `n`, but without specific details about their intended purposes, it's challenging to confirm they solve identical problems directly from the provided snippets. However, if we assume that both are designed to process some form of comparative analysis between two sets (`a_arr` and `b_arr`) under certain conditions (like comparing elements by index for a range up to `n-1`), then in broad strokes, they could be solving related problems but not necessarily identical ones. The first code calculates dates based on months and days, while the second computes sums and comparisons between two arrays. Without more context or specific problem statements, this is an assumption rather than a definitive answer.+++
 
***Data Id 950: No. These two sets of codes appear to address different problems based on their structure and input/output expectations.

Code 1 counts occurrences of a specific character ('2') in an input string (N). Code 2 seems to be a mix of Ruby code, attempting to solve an entirely different problem involving three integers N, M, K as inputs, possibly related to divisibility or finding factors. They do not seem to have the same inputs and outputs based on their design.+++
 
***Data Id 171: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) are designed to solve the problem described in The Secret Number from Aizu Online Judge, which involves finding a sequence of digits that satisfies certain conditions based on a given matrix input. Although implemented in different programming languages with differing syntax and styles, both code snippets aim to accomplish the same objective: calculating the longest number sequence derived from the given matrix while adhering to specified rules (e.g., considering only digits 0-9). The output of both codes is expected to match if they are correctly implemented for this specific problem.+++
 
***Data Id 552: No. While both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (in Ruby) may seem to tackle similar problems, they are not solving the exact same problem based on the given details. Without a specific problem statement that both codes intend to solve, it's challenging to directly compare their purposes or outputs. However, let me clarify what each code does:

Code 1 (Java): This Java program first calculates an integer `k` using the `findK(int n)` method based on a specific mathematical condition related to `n`. It then generates and prints out a table that represents a solution to some problem. The details of this problem aren't directly provided in your description, but it involves dynamically creating and filling arrays according to some logic determined by `k` (calculated from `n`).

Code 2 (Ruby): This Ruby script calculates the smallest non-negative difference between `n % k` and `k - n % k`, which doesn't directly indicate what problem it is solving based on this calculation alone. The purpose of these calculations seems unrelated to generating a table as in Code 1 unless there's a specific context linking them, which isn't provided here.

Given the descriptions:
- **Code 1** deals with calculating `k` and then constructing/printing an array based on some logic (the exact problem is not specified).
- **Code 2** calculates a specific value related to `n` and `k` but doesn't involve table generation or construction.

Therefore, without additional context linking these two pieces of code together into solving the same problem with identical inputs and outputs, it's accurate to say they don't solve identical problems based on the provided information. Each serves a different purpose as described above.+++

Both Code1 (in Java) and Code2 (written in Ruby) solve the same problem, which is to find the sum of distances between consecutive numbers after sorting them when given N and M values, where N >= M. They both take inputs for M and then read an array X with M elements, sort it, calculate differences between consecutive elements, sort those differences, and sum a subset based on the provided conditions (N <= M). The outputs will be identical for equivalent input sets. However, note that there's a slight discrepayer in how inputs are taken due to language syntax and conventions.+++
 
***Data Id 118: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they have different approaches to solving the problem. Code1 uses dynamic programming in a nested loop structure while Code2 uses an array-based approach without explicit dynamic programming implementation details provided. Additionally, there are syntax differences between Java (Code1) and Ruby (Code2).+++
 
***Data Id 5: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 946: Code1 solves a different problem than Code2, so the answer is "no."

Code1 appears to be an implementation of a program that reads input for contest numbers and their increases over days from the user (or possibly hardcoded values), then it prints out random numbers between 1 and 26. This does not seem directly related to counting lines or solving similar problems as Code2 might suggest.

Code2, on the other hand, seems like a snippet that could be part of a solution for calculating some sort of score based on contest numbers and decreases (possibly using an array `c` representing decreases) and increases (`s`). However, without full context or additional information about Code2's intended functionality, it's challenging to definitively compare its problem-solving approach with that of Code1.

Given the provided snippets, we cannot say they solve identical problems based on available details.+++
 
***Data Id 531: No. Code1 is a Java program that reads an integer array input, computes a certain result based on the values in the array, and prints out the result. On the other hand, code2 is a Ruby script that takes four space-separated integers as inputs (possibly from STDIN), calculates the sum of these numbers modulo 60 to get seconds past the hour, and then calculates the total minutes by dividing the hours by 60. These two codes solve different problems with distinct approaches and outputs in their respective languages.+++
 
***Data Id 360: No+++
 
***Data Id 927: No. Code1 is an example of Java code that calculates something based on input, while Code2 is a Ruby equivalent calculating a specific grid-based pattern count. They serve different purposes without direct equivalence in problem statements.

```ruby
# This code does not directly solve the same problem as Code1 but has similar logic structure. It counts certain patterns within an array representing rows of strings.
h, w = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
used = Array.new(h) { Array.new(w, false) }
s = h.times.map { gets.chomp }
ans = 0
h.times do |i|
    w.times do |j|
        next if used[i][j]
        q = [[i, j]]
        used[i][j] = true
        a = b = 0
        s[i][j] == "." ? (a += 1) : (b += 1)
        while q.any?
            x, y = q.shift
            return if x == h || used[x + 1][y] # Return early for out-of-bounds to match the original Java logic's condition
            next unless s[x - 1][y] != s[x - 1][y + 1] && !used[x - 1][y]
            q.push [x - 1, y]
            used[x - 1][y] = true
            a += (s[x - 1][y] == ".") ? 1 : 0
        end
    ans += a * b # Sum up the multiplied counts for patterns found in each row
end
puts ans
```+++
 
***Data Id 120: Yes, both `code1` and `code2` essentially solve the same problem but in different programming languages (Java for `code1` and Ruby for `code2`). Both programs aim to determine which player wins a game under certain rules when given an array of stones and a maximum number of moves. The approach in both codes involves dynamic programming with memoization, albeit implemented differently due to language-specific idioms and conventions.+++
 
***Data Id 483: No. While both codes aim to solve a related problem involving graphs (with adjacency matrices in Java's version and an undirected graph representation using sets of edges), their implementation details, structures used, and methods for processing differ significantly due to the languages and paradigms involved. Code 1 uses recursion with list manipulation in Java, while Code 2 employs a recursive approach within Ruby, leveraging its Set collection and more functional programming style. They solve problems related to graph traversal but do not directly address identical inputs and outputs as described without further context on the specific problem they are intended to solve.+++
 
***Data Id 827: No.

The provided Java and Python snippets are not solving the same problem based on their functionality and output.

Java code (code1) reads three integers from user input and checks if exactly two of them are equal while all three are different, printing "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

Python code (code2) performs a selection sort algorithm on an array provided as input, sorting the array in ascending order, and prints the sorted array followed by the count of swaps made during the sorting process.+++
 
***Data Id 193: Yes. Both code snippets are designed to take an array of integers as input, sort it in ascending order, calculate a specific value based on the sorted array's properties, and print that calculated sum. Despite differences in syntax due to programming language variations (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2), they solve identical problems with matching inputs and outputs when given an integer 'n' followed by 'n' integers as input.+++
 
***Data Id 157: No, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is written in Java and defines a class structure to process input data for solving a specific problem related to finding answers based on given conditions using loops and math functions. On the other hand, Code2 is written in Ruby and directly solves an equivalent mathematical problem but doesn't follow the object-oriented programming style as seen in code1. The approach and language used are different, indicating that while they may solve similar types of problems (likely related to square roots or multiplication), their implementations differ significantly.+++
 
***Data Id 682: No. Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems with different implementations.+++
 
***Data Id 943: No, while both codes aim to solve a problem related to binary arrays (potentially solving the subset sum problem), they approach it differently using different algorithms: Binary Search Tree vs Breadth-First Search. They don't directly correspond to each other but share an underlying conceptual similarity in handling and exploring binary array possibilities efficiently.+++

***Data Id 756: Yes, Code1 and Code2 solve similar problems but in different programming languages and environments (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2). Both codes implement a merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers; however, the syntax, structure, and idiomatic ways vary significantly between Java and Ruby. The core logic behind their sorting functions is conceptually aligned - both aim to achieve the same objective: sorting arrays efficiently by recursively dividing the input array into halves, sorting each half, and merging them back together in a sorted manner. Despite these similarities in purpose, they are adapted for their respective languages' conventions and paradigms, demonstrating how different programming languages can approach problem-solving tasks differently while still striving to achieve optimal performance through thoughtful coding practices.

***Data Id 300: No.

The two pieces of code have different structures and programming paradigms, although they might be aimed at solving a similar problem related to union-find (also known as disjoint set). Code 1 is written in Java using object-oriented programming principles with an emphasis on classes and static methods, whereas Code 2 is implemented in Ruby within the AtCoder module framework. While both may ultimately solve the same type of problem, they are not identical copies due to their distinct languages and design choices.+++
 
***Data Id 337: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve similar problems, likely involving bit manipulation for permutation calculations, although they implement it differently.+++
 
***Data Id 647: No. Code1 calculates the minimum difference between two permutations based on an array of numbers, while Code2 determines the minimum number of trucks needed to transport a given weight limit (k) from an array of weights without exceeding it. They solve different problems with distinct approaches and inputs/outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 980: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that calculates something based on prime numbers within an array using given input, while Code2 appears to be Ruby code aiming to find gaps between consecutive elements in an integer list after sorting them by their parity (even/odd). The two codes have different structures and purposes.+++

***Data Id 278: No. While both pieces of code aim to find the number of unique combinations within a given range that sum up to another integer, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby/RSpec-like pseudocode for Code 2) with distinct approaches and syntaxes. Therefore, without executing them side by side or translating one into the other's language, it cannot be concluded that they solve identical problems exactly as described. However, conceptually addressing a similar problem does not guarantee an identical implementation due to language-specific idioms and libraries available.+++
 
***Data Id 345: No, while both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve similar problems related to graph theory (e.g., finding paths in a given scenario), they are implemented differently in Java using object-oriented programming (Code 1) versus a more concise Ruby solution (Code 2).

Code 1 provides a structured approach, defining classes and methods for input reading, processing data, and outputting results. It uses various Java features like arrays, loops, conditional statements, and standard libraries to solve the problem.

On the other hand, Code 2 demonstrates a Ruby solution using array manipulation, hashes (associative arrays), and string interpolation in a single line for finding if it's possible to reach all nodes given specific constraints. While both codes aim at similar objectives, they are implemented differently due to language differences and programming paradigms.+++
 
***Data Id 426: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby; they solve similar but not necessarily identical problems without explicit comparison details provided.+++
 
***Data Id 971: No. Code 1 solves a different problem compared to Code 2, which focuses on counting semi-prime pairs (n/2). Code 1 involves sorting arrays of integers and finding a sum based on specific conditions related to array indices. These two pieces of code solve distinct problems with no direct correlation in inputs or outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 99: No.+++
 
***Data Id 669: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 finds a pattern in a string that matches another string by replacing '?' characters, while Code2 calculates a result based on input numbers. They are not equivalent.+++
 
***Data Id 551: No. The two codes provided serve different purposes and are not equivalent in functionality. Code 1 is a Java program that determines whether an integer input represents a triangular number (a number that can be represented as a triangle) and then generates the first N rows of Pascal's Triangle, while Code 2 seems to be a Ruby script that calculates the remainder when dividing two integers.

They solve different problems with no direct connection in functionality or output.+++
 
***Data Id 925: No.
support: The two codes solve different problems based on their structure and logic implementation.

Code 1 in Java reads an integer `n` from input, creates an array of size `n`, populates it with user inputs, checks if the sum is divisible by 1e2 (i.e., 10), sorts the array when the sum isn't divisible by 10, and prints out a modified version of the initial sum based on some conditions within the loop that handles sorting.

Code 2 in Ruby reads two integers `h` and `w`, creates a nested array with inputs for height (`h`) and width (`w`), uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the total count of black tiles surrounded by white ones, updates counts within BFS traversal, and prints out the final answer.

These two pieces of code are not equivalent in problem solving or expected output.+++
 
***Data Id 896: No. Code 1 calculates a value based on input parameters `n` (an integer) and `m` (also an integer), while Code 2 finds the next prime number greater than or equal to `base`. The two codes solve different problems, so they are not identical in terms of inputs and outputs for all possible scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 708: No.+++
 
***Data Id 102: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 solve the same problem, given the same inputs for `a`, `b`, and `C`. They calculate the semi-perimeter (`S`), the perimeter (`L`), and the height (`h`) of a triangle using Heron's formula and trigonometric functions.+++
 
***Data Id 955: No.
Support: Code 1 searches for occurrences of '2' in a string, while Code 2 solves a dynamic programming problem using a grid structure. Their functionalities differ significantly.+++
 
***Data Id 698: No. Code 1 is a Java program that uses Disjoint-set Union operations, while Code 2 is a Ruby script performing simple arithmetic comparisons based on user input. They do not solve identical problems nor have the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 594: No, Code 1 in Java and Code 2 in Ruby solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown of what each code does:

Code 1 (Java):
This code takes three integers as input from the user using a Scanner object, sorts them in ascending order, calculates various differences between elements, and then prints out an integer value based on those calculations.

Code 2 (Ruby):
This Ruby code reads multiple numbers from standard input, splits each line into two space-separated integers, calculates their product, performs certain operations involving square roots and the maximum of a number and another variable, accumulates sums in an array, and finally prints these sums. The goal is not explicitly mentioned but appears to involve manipulating mathematical relationships based on input values.

Since they solve different problems with potentially varying inputs and outputs, the answer is no.+++
 
***Data Id 620: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 491: Yes. Both codes are designed to find out if there are exactly two distinct integers in a given input array of size three, which implies that these programs serve the same purpose with matching expected inputs and outputs. However, it's important to note the differences in coding style and language specifics between Java (code1) and Ruby (code2).+++
 
***Data Id 894: No.+++
 
***Data Id 0: Yes. Both codes aim to determine if the sum of a number's digits, when taken modulo 9, equals zero. They both perform similar operations but are structured differently in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2). However, since they achieve the same result with identical inputs and outputs, the answer is yes.+++
 
***Data Id 283: No. Code 1 is a Java program that solves a specific problem using object-oriented programming principles, while Code 2 is a Ruby script designed to perform a similar task without involving any object-oriented concepts. They solve the same general problem but are implemented in different languages and styles. Therefore, they cannot be considered identical solutions for solving the exact same problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 655: Yes. Both pieces of code appear to be solving a similar problem related to graph traversal, possibly finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph (as they are using BFS-like approach). They take input for the number of vertices/nodes (`n`), edges represented by pairs of starting and ending points, and queries that involve start node, goal node, and time limit. However, there is a discrepamin+++
 
***Data Id 137: No. While both pieces of code aim to manipulate an integer array, they approach the problem differently based on different requirements specified in each snippet. Code 1 involves sorting, calculating differences, and adjusting values within a given set of constraints, while Code 2 focuses on identifying odd numbers, equalizing parity among elements, and then finding the closest value to the maximum element for adjustments. These operations result in solving potentially different problems. Thus, without further context that aligns their objectives directly, we cannot conclude they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 274: No.

While both codes aim to solve similar counting problems, they are implemented in different languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2) and have slightly different approaches to solving their respective problems. However, without specific context on the inputs and outputs expected by these programs, it's not guaranteed that they will always produce identical results. Generally speaking, if both programs are designed to calculate the number of unique combinations (combinations of three numbers whose sum equals a given value) within a set up to n, they might solve similar types of problems but with potential differences in performance and coding style due to language-specific features.+++
 
***Data Id 760: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby. They are not directly comparable as they belong to different programming languages. However, both pieces of code aim to perform input operations, numerical processing (sorting/dividing), and output the result based on a given logic with inputs taken from standard input. But due to language differences, their implementations and possibly even functionality might differ when adapted or ported between languages.+++

***Data Id 287: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs. Code1 counts occurrences of certain values in two arrays, determines if there are an equal number of even/odd totals for these specific values, while Code2 sums the input frequencies and checks if they match a predefined list pattern without considering odd or even statuses explicitly.+++
 
***Data Id 217: No.+++
 
***Data Id 612: No.

The two codes solve different problems based on their structure and intended functionality.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads an input string, processes it to count occurrences of 'T' while using stack operations (pushing 'S' when encountering characters other than 'T' and popping them), and outputs the total count including remaining unpopped characters at the end.

Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby and reads two numbers from input, compares them, and then prints the greater value minus one or just returns the first number based on their comparison.

Therefore, these codes are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 11: No. Code1 checks if all characters in a string are either 'U'/'D' followed by an even index character being 'R' or odd index being 'L', while Code2 checks for the presence of 'L' or 'R' on different pairs from split input, without considering other conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 502: No.+++
 
***Data Id 640: No.

While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) aim to address related concepts such as permutations and finding elements' positions within a set of permutations, they are not directly solving identical problems based on the provided inputs and outputs description.

Code1 is designed for reading input from standard input (stdin), creating a 2-dimensional array representing votes or preferences, calculating an outcome using this matrix (presumably some form of weighted vote counting algorithm), and printing it out. It seems to handle multiple sets of votes/preferences per the while loop example provided but lacks explicit details on what "votes" refer to in this context.
 Written with Java language syntax, its main focus is processing input arrays representing preferences or votes and calculating an outcome based on these inputs without explicitly mentioning a specific problem domain like rank-order elections.

Code2 appears to be solving the minimum difference between two permutations (finding the absolute difference in positions of elements `p` and `q`) within all possible permutations for given input numbers (`n`, `p`, `q`). It calculates this by generating all permutations, finding their indices relative to inputs `p` and `q`, and computing the minimum distance. This solution seems more specific than Code1 as it explicitly addresses a problem involving permutation positions rather than handling an array of votes or preferences.

Given these different focuses and approaches (a general matrix-based calculation vs. solving a specific permutations-related problem), they are not directly addressing the same inputs/outputs scenario based on the information provided.+++
 
***Data Id 865: No, these two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 defines a Java program that uses IO classes for input/output operations while solving an unspecified problem involving pairs of integers. On the other hand, code2 is written in Ruby language that calculates cost based on given values using if-else conditions. The logic implemented in these two codes appears to be different and serve different purposes without any explicit mention about their identical nature or inputs/outputs equivalence.+++
 
***Data Id 206: Yes. Both codes are designed to perform a similar task, which involves reading from input, processing arrays representing tasks (each element in an array represents a time taken for each job), and calculating the maximum product of two minimum times across all jobs while avoiding certain conditions. The slight differences in implementation details do not change their fundamental approach or output, given identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 570: No. Code1 is a Java program that calculates values related to triangle geometry, while Code2 seems like an attempt to perform calculations using shell commands similar to Python's eval() function but it doesn't directly relate to the problem solved by Code1. They solve different problems and are implemented in different programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 461: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 298: No.
support: Code 1 and Code 2 are not solving identical problems, as they differ in language (Java vs. Ruby), input/output handling, data structures used (ArrayList in Java vs. Arrays in Ruby), and specific implementation details of the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) algorithm.+++
 
***Data Id 824: No

The two codes are not solving identical problems; they have different languages, data handling, and logic for determining results. Code 1 is written in Java checking if exactly one of A, B, C is equal to another number while code 2 counts the occurrences of 'W' and 'E' characters from input strings using Ruby.+++
 
***Data Id 832: Yes. Both pieces of code aim to sort an array using a selection sort algorithm, although implemented in different programming languages (Java for "code1" and Ruby for "code2"). The core logic is essentially the same: iterate over the elements, find the minimum element in each iteration, and swap it with the current position being considered. They both output the sorted array as well as the number of swaps made during the process.+++
 
***Data Id 358: No. While both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to calculate a certain result, they are implemented differently in terms of approach (iterative vs recursive) and language used (Java vs Ruby). The logic is not identical due to differences in programming languages. However, if the question strictly asks for solving "identical problems" with the same inputs and outputs using only these two code snippets as context, it's important to note that without additional information on how inputs are processed or constraints applied outside of this snippet (e.g., handling large numbers efficiently), a direct comparison may not fully capture the nuances in performance, readability, or functionality specific to each language and its standard libraries/features.

To directly compare their logic based solely on what's given: Code 1 is written in Java and performs an iterative calculation of `i` by doubling `X` while it's less than or equal to `Y`, similar to the Ruby code snippet (Code 2). However, they are not identical implementations as seen through a pure logic lens but share conceptual similarity.

If you require a more detailed comparison considering their actual inputs and outputs with specific examples, please provide those details for an accurate analysis.+++
 
***Data Id 720: No.

Code 1 reads three integers from standard input, performs a calculation involving these numbers (although it does not use all possible calculations shown in comments), and prints an output based on this calculation. Code 2 reads two lines of input that are expected to contain space-separated integers, processes each line according to the given logic, and then checks if both lists `fst` and `snd` have elements or not, printing "IMPOSSIBLE" or "POSSIBLE" accordingly. The problems they solve appear different based on the provided implementations.+++

***Data Id 230: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) aim to solve the same problem using dynamic programming, by reading input from stdin and finding the maximum number of disjoint paths in a given grid under certain constraints. They are implemented differently due to language-specific syntax but achieve similar functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 788: No. While both codes are written in Java and appear to perform similar operations, they solve different problems. Code1 is an implementation of a specific task called "TaskX" which takes input from standard streams, processes it using Union-Find data structure (a type of disjoint set), counts the number of roots for each element, and outputs this count as its solution.

On the other hand, Code2 appears to be part of an arithmetic expression evaluator that calculates a result based on some transformation of input values and uses modular arithmetic with a large prime modulus (m=10^9+7). The inputs, operations performed within these codes, and their output formats are entirely different.

Therefore, even though both codes involve processing inputs to generate outputs in Java, they do not solve identical problems based on the provided contexts.+++
 
***Data Id 143: Yes. Both Code1 in Java and Code2 in Ruby solve the same problem, which is to find a specific output based on three integer inputs (A, B, C) that are read from standard input. The solution involves calculating an expression using these integers and then printing out the result according to certain conditions related to even or odd sums. Despite differences in syntax and language features, both codes achieve the same objective with equivalent logic.+++
 
***Data Id 292: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is finding the minimum difference between any two numbers in a given list after sorting it, and then multiplying this difference by (n-1) for all n-th elements of the input list where the smallest differences are found. However, they have different approaches to solving it: code 1 uses Java with classes and methods, while code 2 is written in Ruby.+++
 
***Data Id 822: No. Code 1 and Code 2 are written in Java and Ruby, respectively, but they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the provided information. Code 1 is about finding all possible pairs of elements that sum up to a given value using depth-first search (DFS), while Code 2 calculates the minimum number of steps required to move from leftmost edge to rightmost edge in a grid, where 'W' and 'E' represent moving west and east, respectively.+++
 
***Data Id 228: No. While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) may be attempting to solve similar graph-related problems, they are written differently and implement logic in their own unique way based on the language's syntax and features. To determine if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs, a direct comparison is needed by running both codes with equivalent test cases.+++

***Data Id 173: No.+++
 
***Data Id 940: No, while both codes aim to solve related problems involving binary arrays and calculations based on input data, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and have distinct approaches for processing arrays and solving specific tasks such as searching for a solution within the array structure. Code1 uses Java's standard library features like `Arrays` and `Math`, whereas Code2 utilizes Ruby's native methods and data structures, including loops and conditional statements to iterate over the input data and solve the problem in their respective ways.+++
 
***Data Id 312: No. While both pieces of code aim to process integer input and output a result based on certain operations, they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have distinct syntaxes and functionalities that lead to separate implementations. Additionally, code2 does not provide the complete equivalent logic or functionality as described by code1 due to differences between languages.

Here's a closer comparison:

Code 1 in Java (as given):
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        // 整数の入力
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sce.nextInt();
        int c = sc.nextInt();
        // 出力
        int o = c-a+b;
        System.out.println(o > 0 ? o : 0);
    }
}
```

Ruby (equivalent logic, though not identical to code1):
```ruby
puts gets.chomp.split.map(&:to_i).first
p [0, c-a+b].max
```
Note that this Ruby snippet does not have the same conditional output as in Java and lacks the input collection from user (like `Scanner` usage), which is a major difference compared to code1.+++
 
***Data Id 409: No. The two codes have different approaches to solving a problem, but they do not necessarily solve the exact same problem as described in the provided context. Code 1 calculates some sums related to differences between array elements, while Code 2 seems to calculate balances at each step considering adjacent differences and past balance. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine if they are identical.+++

***Data Id 660: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is designed to calculate the number of subarrays in an array that can sum up to a given value `p` without exceeding it. It takes an input integer array (`ws`) representing weights and a long value `p`, then returns an integer indicating how many such subarrays exist within the bounds set by `p`.

Code2, on the other hand, appears to be an algorithm for solving a substring search problem where you are given two strings (or arrays of characters in this case), and it finds the starting index of one string (`T`) as a contiguous subsequence within another string (`S`). It replaces non-'?' characters with 'a's and then checks if `T` can be found in `S`. If found, it outputs `S` with `T` replaced by '?'.

Therefore, while both code snippets are written in Ruby (which differs from Java), they address entirely different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 320: No.

Although both pieces of code appear to solve similar mathematical problems related to arithmetic progressions, they are structured differently and represent separate solutions. Code1 is a Java program that calculates the product of an arithmetic progression modulo MOD, while Code2 uses Ruby syntax for a recursive solution to compute factorials with modular multiplication. These two code snippets address different problems but share similarities in using mathematical operations within their logic.+++
 
***Data Id 521: No. Code1 and Code2 are solving different problems based on their given inputs and logic implementation.

Code1 is reading an array of integers from input, then calculates a value `ans` using provided formula involving two constants (`A` and `B`) along with the differences between consecutive elements in the array. The output is simply printing this calculated value.

Code2 reads a single integer (representing `n`), splits it into an array of integers, then iterates through that array to check for consecutive numbers equal to each other. It counts and prints the number of times such sequences occur.

So they are solving distinct problems even if given the same inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 653: No.+++
 
***Data Id 223: No. While both codes aim to find the absolute difference between two permutations of an array, they approach the problem differently in terms of implementation style, efficiency, and reliability on edge cases (like when P equals Q). Code 1 is more generic, allowing for different types that implement a `Comparable` interface, whereas Code 2 specifically deals with arrays. The approaches are not identical but solve similar problems; hence the answer is "no" without going into comparative analysis depths.+++

***Data Id 917: No, these two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 takes three strings as input to compare their lengths in a specific manner while Code 2 performs number crunching calculations without any apparent relation to string processing shown in Code 1. They appear unrelated based on provided snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 397: No. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 is written in Ruby. Although they may seem to solve similar problems based on their actions (taking input, sorting numbers, and printing them), they are implemented using different programming languages and have distinct syntaxes and language-specific features.+++
 
***Data Id 619: No, while both codes aim to perform a similar operation on a matrix input and calculate an output based on certain conditions, they are implemented quite differently in their structure and logic flow. Code1 (Java) uses nested loops for processing the 2D array based on specific rules about digits and zeros, whereas Code2 (Ruby) simplifies the problem to finding the sum of elements at particular positions without explicitly handling digit/zero checks or constructing an intermediate dp (dynamic programming table). Therefore, despite solving a similar overarching conceptual problem, their implementation details are distinct.

Here's a high-level comparison:

1. **Language Differences**: The first code is written in Java, known for its verbose and structured syntax, while the second snippet is in Ruby, recognized for its concise and expressive nature.
   
2. **Implementation Approach**: Code1 (Java) focuses on a detailed step-by-step processing of the 2D array to determine the optimal path/value at each cell based on predefined conditions involving digits and zeros. This involves constructing an auxiliary data structure (`dp`) to hold intermediate results, making it suitable for more complex scenarios that require backtracking or dynamic programming techniques.
   
3. Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a model used by marketers to analyze the purchasing behavior of customers in retail stores. MBA involves recording each transaction's contents as items and determining associations between them, predicting future purchases based on these relationships. It can be applied for product placement optimization, inventory management, personalized marketing campaigns, etc.

**MBA Implementation using Python:**
```python
from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data: a list of transactions (each transaction is a list of items bought by a customer)
transactions = [['Milk', 'Onion', 'Nutmeg'], 
                ['Dog Food', 'Milk', 'Milk'], 
                ['Dog Food', 'Tuna Fish'], 
                ['Tuna Fish', 'Milk']]

# Transform the transactions into a one-hot encoded matrix using TransactionEncoder from mlxtend library.
te = TransactionEncoder()
data = te.fit_transform(transactions).toarray()
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=te.columns_)
print("MBA Matrix:\n", df)
```
This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of MBA using Python's `mlxtend` library for transforming raw transaction data into a one-hot encoded matrix representation. This is an essential step in many MBA applications, such as customer segmentation analysis and product placement optimization. However, this example doesn't cover the complete end-to-end scenario of calculating the optimal pathfinder solution; it only shows how to find_max_length_product association rules, but not a full array for (N, h, w=te.fit(n,h = 1
    # Create an itemset.int i= 
    # Store total, h = [strategy;
    if __main method() {
    strategy_list.append(w}

***Data Id 299: No. While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) aim to implement a Union-Find data structure, they are implemented differently in syntax and style according to their respective programming languages. Additionally, there is an error in the Java version where `tree` variable should be declared as static and initialized outside of the `main` method for it to work correctly. Moreover, Code1 lacks comments, which could explain the purpose behind certain lines or methods if needed for understanding by someone not familiar with the code structure.+++
 
***Data Id 785: No. Code1 is a Java program that reads input from standard in, processes it, and prints output to standard out. Code2 appears to be an expression using some unconventional syntax possibly related to another language (like Perl), but it doesn't directly relate to or solve the same problem as Code1. They are not equivalent.+++
 
***Data Id 993: No. While both codes perform different operations, they don't solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the given information. Code1 checks for palindrome strings after ignoring two characters from the end, whereas code2 calculates a total based on input conditions not directly related to string manipulation or checking palindromes.+++
 
***Data Id 887: Yes, both Code1 and Code2 can be solving similar problems if we analyze their structures and functionalities. However, without a specific problem statement, it's challenging to determine exactly what they are intended for. Nevertheless, I will provide an interpretation of how these codes might work on the same problem set based on their structure:

Code1 is structured as follows:
- It reads inputs using `InputReader`, processes them, and prints outputs through a `PrintWriter`. 
- The `Task` class contains logic to solve a specific test case.
- A while loop runs multiple tests (as defined by `testNumber`), each time calling the `solve()` method of the `Task` class with inputs from an `InputReader`, and outputs using a `Debugger`.

Code2, on the other hand, consists only of two lines:
- It reads N and M as input separated by space.
- Then it calculates `(18*M+N)*100*2**M` and prints out the result.

Based on this interpretation, both codes can solve similar problems related to processing integer inputs and producing outputs based on certain calculations:

For example, if we assume that Code2 is solving a problem where you need to compute `(18*M+N)*100*2**M` for given N (the number of test cases) and M (a specific input), then it might not directly solve the same set of problems as Code1. This is because Code1 seems to handle inputs, processing logic through a `Task`, and outputting results with a loop over multiple tests using an `InputReader` and `PrintWriter`.

However, if we reinterpret Code2's problem within the context where N and M are specific test case parameters (e.g., calculating `(18*M+N)*100*2**M` for every value of M from 0 to some upper limit or a range), then it could be part of a larger program that also includes handling inputs, processing logic, and outputs similar to Code1 but with a specific calculation as its core functionality.

In conclusion, without more explicit context about the intended problem each code is solving, we can only infer potential overlap based on their structures and functionalities. The direct comparison between both codes solving identical problems would require additional clarification or understanding of the problem domain they aim to address.+++
 
***Data Id 309: Yes. Both Code 1 (Java version) and Code 2 (Ruby version) appear to solve an identical problem, assuming the input is formatted correctly for each language's parsing methods. However, without explicit context on "gets" in Ruby, a direct comparison of outputs with full certainty isn't feasible here due to minor differences in handling inputs and execution environments between Java and Ruby. But conceptually, they are designed to perform similar operations given correct input formats.+++
 
***Data Id 17: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to check if a given string has an equal number of 'L' characters at even indices and 'R' characters at odd indices, then print "Yes" otherwise "No". However, there is a subtle difference in how they are written due to language differences (Java vs. Ruby). Despite this, their purpose and functionality align for the described problem with the same inputs yielding identical outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 661: Yes. Both Code1 (a Java program) and Code2 (an equivalent Ruby script) aim to find a way to insert substring 't' into string 's' at positions that do not violate the rule where the character in 's' at position `j` is different from both 't' and any other specified character "?" when comparing with 't'. They solve identical problems given the same inputs, aiming to output a modified version of 's' or indicating it's unrestorable. However, this comparison assumes that both codes are intentionally designed for the exact problem statement provided without considering additional constraints and nuances in implementation details between Java and Ruby.+++

***Data Id 119: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Shell Script) are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to be different representations of a dynamic programming problem related to selecting stones from an array under certain constraints. However, they do not perform the exact same operations or provide equivalent results when run.+++
 
***Data Id 624: No. While both codes perform some related operations, they are solving different problems based on their implementation details and output expectations. Code 1 simply calculates a value based on input integers `a` and `b`, while Code 2 performs more complex calculations involving array manipulation to determine a result based on comparisons between two arrays (`T` and `A`) and some arithmetic operations applied over iterations. Without seeing the exact problem statement that both are intended to solve, we cannot say they perform identical tasks with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 226: No.

While both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) aim to solve a similar problem, they are not exactly solving the exact same problem due to differences in their implementation details and structure. The provided Java code reads input using `Scanner` and outputs results directly, whereas the Python code uses list comprehensions and doesn't explicitly read from input but rather assigns input values statically within the script.

Additionally, Code1 makes use of various libraries (`Arrays`, `Collections`, `Math`), which is not apparent in Code2 based on this snippet alone. However, given only the provided code snippets, it's challenging to determine their full equivalence without additional context or a complete comparison.+++
 
***Data Id 48: No, while both codes perform similar tasks in different programming languages (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2), they are not directly comparable as versions of each other solving exactly the same problem due to differences in language syntax, I/O methods, and potential nuances in implementation details. However, conceptually, if given identical inputs, both approaches aim to solve problems related to counting subarrays with equal elements by grouping them accordingly, which suggests a similar underlying logic but implemented differently for each programming context.+++
 
***Data Id 172: No, as they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) but aim to achieve similar functionalities based on understanding provided. However, without executing both programs directly against the exact specifications, it's challenging to assert identical functionality with certainty just from their syntax differences.+++
 
***Data Id 676: No. While both programs aim to count certain combinations, they are implemented differently in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and thus cannot be directly compared as solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs due to language-specific syntax and features.+++
 
***Data Id 242: No. Code1 is a Java program, while Code2 appears to be written in Ruby; they are different languages solving similar but not identical problems due to differences in syntax and capabilities of each language. Additionally, the logic may differ as well.+++
 
***Data Id 103: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 151: No.
- Response time: The complexity of algorithms, implementation styles, and use of libraries differ between Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby). They do not directly match in functionality but approach a similar problem differently. Code 1 has an explicit loop for prime generation, while Code 2 uses Ruby's built-in method `Prime.each` to achieve the same end result more succinctly. However, without specific details on implementation and optimization within each code snippet (e.g., handling large inputs efficiently), it's challenging to directly compare their outputs and performance based solely on the provided snippets.
- Explanation: The primary difference lies in the programming language used and how each solves the problem. Code 1 is written in Java, a statically typed, object-oriented language, while Code 2 uses Ruby, known for its dynamic typing and concise syntax. They solve similar problems but through different approaches within their respective languages' ecosystems. The comparison assumes an understanding of each code snippet's implementation details beyond the provided snippets, which might not directly reflect identical performances due to language-specific optimizations and runtime behaviors.+++
 
***Data Id 314: No.+++
 
***Data Id 716: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that takes three integers as input, sorts them, and prints their sum. Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby, which attempts to calculate all binary representations of numbers from 0 to (2^n)-1 for an input string `s`, using the merge method defined within it. The two codes solve different problems with different inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 644: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems, although they may seem similar at a glance due to their use of graph-related computations (like Floyd-Warshall algorithm in Code2). Here's how each code operates distinctly:

Code1 uses the `Floyd-Warshall` approach within its implementation (`getPosi` method) but is not a standalone application. It reads two integer arrays from standard input, calculates a certain metric (presumably related to permutations or ordering), and outputs this value based on user input. The context seems centered around comparing different permutations of a sequence given some constraints.

Code2, on the other hand, is an implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for solving the shortest path problem in a graph. It reads network information (graph structure) and calculates distances between all pairs of vertices using this algorithm. Subsequently, it processes packet delivery scenarios based on these calculated distances to determine if specific paths are viable within given time constraints.

The differences lie primarily in their input handling (`stdin` usage), the core problem they aim to solve (shortest path calculation vs. permutation comparison), and their outputs (`calculated distance/value` vs. `distance info / "NA"`). These distinctions make it clear that while both codes involve graph theory concepts, they address different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 44: No. While both code snippets aim to calculate a statistical measure (average in code 1, standard deviation in code 2) from input data, they are implemented differently due to language differences (Java vs Ruby). Code 1 uses Java's Stream API for calculations, whereas code 2 demonstrates Ruby syntax and methods. They solve different problems but essentially perform similar statistical operations on the same inputs. The specific problem each snippet solves could be considered slightly different based on their output formatting and directness in printing results (Java prints directly to System.out with formatted output). However, if focusing strictly on whether they compute standard deviation or an equivalent measure given identical input patterns, it's a matter of implementation rather than different problems being solved. Thus, the answer could lean towards "No" when considering their direct functional comparison under strict conditions but acknowledges both address similar statistical problem domains with slight differences in approach and language syntax.+++
 
***Data Id 307: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of calculating `c - (a - b)` and printing the result, considering a case when it might be negative to print "0" instead. However, there are some differences in syntax and programming style between Java and Ruby/Rexx.+++
 
***Data Id 88: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. While both codes involve counting occurrences of blood groups from user input, they are implemented differently in each code. 

Code1 uses a Java program that takes user input using Scanner class, reads it line by line, splits the input based on comma (',') delimiter, and counts the number of occurrences for each blood group 'A', 'B', 'AB' and 'O'. It then prints out these counts. 

Code2 appears to be a Ruby code that uses a Hash to count occurrences of blood groups from an array containing strings with comma-separated values (presumably user input). In this case, it directly operates on the input without reading it line by line. The result is printed using the `p` method in Ruby.

These codes are not identical and have different implementations, so they may yield different outputs for certain inputs or behave differently with other types of input data.+++
 
***Data Id 269: Yes. Both pieces of code are designed to read four integers from input (a, b, c, k), process them according to specific rules, and then output an integer based on these rules. The first piece of code does this using Java's built-in classes for I/O, while the second uses Ruby's `gets` method and array manipulation methods. Despite the language differences, they achieve the same functionality when provided with identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 777: No+++
 
***Data Id 787: No. These two pieces of code (code1 and code2) are written in different programming languages and serve different purposes, so they cannot be said to solve identical problems based on their current form. Code1 is a Java program that reads input from the console, processes it, and outputs results based on hashmap operations. Code2 appears to be an implementation of some mathematical operation using Ruby's syntax but does not directly relate to the problem described in code1.+++
 
***Data Id 709: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 calculates a specific arithmetic operation based on three integer inputs, while Code2 reads input from stdin, performs various operations including splitting and sorting an array of integers, and then prints the smallest sum among those calculations. The outputs are not identical for these two pieces of code given their different functionalities.+++
 
***Data Id 629: No. While both codes perform similar operations involving lists/arrays and calculating results based on given conditions, they are solving different problems based on their structure and logic. Code1 sorts a list of long integers in reverse order and calculates the sum of elements at specific indices, whereas Code2 repeatedly reads input pairs of integers until a condition is met to calculate the maximum possible score after certain operations. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 931: No, while both codes aim to perform similar operations involving factorials and modulo arithmetic, they are implemented in different programming languages (code1 is Java) and use different approaches to solving the problem, so it cannot be determined if they solve identical problems without further analysis.+++
 
***Data Id 52: No. While both Code1 and Code2 aim to process input data, they address different problems based on their structure and logic. Code1 calculates a result based on counting unique combinations in an array (considering the order), whereas Code2 seems designed to manipulate an array of integers to find specific conditions between adjacent elements but without a clear problem statement similar to that of Code1. Therefore, they solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 961: Yes. Both codes aim to solve the problem in different programming languages but conceptually provide similar functionality, although they have structural differences due to language-specific features. Code 1 is written in Java while Code 2 appears to be Ruby code (despite some syntactic inconsistencies that could be misinterpreted). Without detailed input and output requirements or specific problem contexts, it's challenging to make a definitive comparison of their functional equivalence; however, the essence of solving a similar problem seems aligned.

If we strictly interpret your question as whether they solve "identical problems with the same inputs and outputs," without delving into details on how each implementation might vary in handling specific edge cases or optimizations, then yes, they conceptually address comparable issues—albeit through different syntaxes and possibly slight differences in approach due to language features.

However, it's important to clarify that a direct "yes" answer assumes similar inputs and expected outputs without considering the nuanced implementation details of each code snippet. Given the discrepancies in programming languages and potential interpretation errors (like the Ruby example provided), this answer should be taken with caution regarding exact equivalency. Each language has its own paradigms, idioms, and optimizations that might affect how they solve a problem or their efficiency under specific conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 964: No, code1 and code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they are different in terms of their approach to solving a problem. Code1 appears to be implementing a specific dynamic programming solution for some kind of optimization or computation involving arrays C, N, D, and c. Meanwhile, Code2 reads input from standard input, sorts two other arrays (as and cs), and calculates a count based on the sorted elements' indices. The context and objective of these two snippets are not provided, making it difficult to directly compare them as solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, they differ in their logic, structure, and intended outcome.+++
 
***Data Id 851: Yes, both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (in Ruby) appear to solve similar problems based on the provided descriptions and their output formats. Both pieces of code aim to read a certain number of input lines, process them according to some rules (though details about these processing steps are not fully described in your question), and then sort/summarize this data into a specific format for output. However, without explicit problem statements or expected outputs, it's challenging to confirm identical functionalities beyond the structural similarities in handling input and generating an ordered list of results based on time or another criterion specified by the processing logic.+++
 
***Data Id 893: No.+++
 
***Data Id 494: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem with the same inputs and outputs, but they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2).+++
 
***Data Id 987: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems and have different approaches to solving them. Code1 is a Java program that takes input from standard input, processes it according to its logic (which involves iterating over possible configurations), and produces an output based on the processing results. On the other hand, Code2 is a Ruby script that directly calculates the answer without any input/output operations or complex processing; instead, it simply finds the length of the longest palindromic substring in given string 'S'.+++

***Data Id 60: No.+++
 
***Data Id 508: No.+++
 
***Data Id 923: No. Code1 is a Java program that reads input to calculate sum of all numbers divisible by 10, minimum value not divisible by s, and conditional logic based on count of numbers divisible by 10 and sum's divisibility by 10. Code2 appears to be an implementation in Ruby using BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to find the total black-white area difference where 'black' corresponds to "#" characters, but it does not match the described logic of code1 nor solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 650: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 is a Java program that implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive edge weights, while Code 2 seems to be an attempt at implementing a binary search solution for a problem related to maximizing or minimizing some quantity based on given constraints, but it lacks context and full implementation details. Therefore, they are not equivalent solutions to the same problem.+++
 
***Data Id 854: No, Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs.

Code 1 calculates the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all numbers from a given list of integers. It does this by sorting the list in ascending order and finding the least common multiple (LCM) using Euclidean algorithm.

On the other hand, Code 2 processes input representing examination results for students. It calculates the number of programs passed by each student who received an "AC" grade on their assignments (programs written). The result is given in terms of total programs passed and the number of students with passing grades.

So, although both codes involve processing integer inputs and using loops and arrays or hash tables, they solve different problems. Therefore, I cannot say if they will have identical inputs and outputs without specific input cases provided.+++
 
***Data Id 311: Yes. Both codes solve similar problems with the same inputs and expected outputs given the described behavior. However, note that there are some differences in syntax and language used (Java vs Ruby). The core logic of taking three integers, subtracting one from another, comparing the result to a third integer, and printing an output based on that comparison is present in both examples.+++
 
***Data Id 188: No.

Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 is written in Ruby. They have different structures, syntaxes, and capabilities. However, I can analyze their functionality to determine if they solve identical problems based on provided inputs and outputs.

Code 1 reads two integers from the standard input and prints out a decremented value of `a` when it's less than or equal to `b`. Code 2 reads two integers as well but calculates the difference between them after adjusting for `A-1` if `B >= A`, then outputs that value.

Without specific inputs and expected outputs, we can't be sure they solve identical problems, but based on their described functionality, it doesn't seem like they are intended to produce the same results given different input data.+++
 
***Data Id 142: No. Code1 calculates a result based on input integers A, B, C using arithmetic operations, while Code2 manipulates arrays of integers derived from input to find an output under certain conditions involving odd numbers. They solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 453: No. Code1 is written in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby. They also have different approaches to solving the problem, so they don't solve the exact same problem even though they seem to produce similar output for given input.+++
 
***Data Id 583: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with different implementations in Java and Ruby, respectively. Code1 seems to be related to a problem involving prime numbers, set operations, and integer ranges, while Code2 appears to focus on calculating an integer sum, finding unique elements within an array, and determining the outcome based on these calculations.+++

***Data Id 732: No+++
 
***Data Id 699: No, they do not solve the identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as they are implemented in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and serve different purposes.

Code 1 is an implementation of a graph-based problem in Java that counts the number of friends' pairs given certain connections between people. Code 2 appears to be a snippet written in Ruby, which calculates a result based on some conditions applied to three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Without context, it's not clear if these two snippets are related or solve the same problem.+++

***Data Id 842: No. While both pieces of code have similar functionality in terms of taking inputs and performing calculations, they are written in different programming languages (Java vs Ruby) and use distinct approaches to achieve their goals. Additionally, Code 2 does not directly solve the same problem as described for Code 1 but seems to focus on sorting an array based on input values from multiple lines, which is a different task. Therefore, without further context that ties these specific examples together in solving identical problems, my answer remains no.+++
 
***Data Id 646: Yes. Both codes are solving identical problems using different programming languages (Java in code1 and Ruby in code2). They both find permutations of integers that satisfy a given condition, comparing them to predefined sequences P and Q, and outputting the absolute difference between their counts.+++
 
***Data Id 786: No. The provided codes are different in terms of their functionality and purpose. Code1 is a Java program that processes input to generate group memberships, while Code2 appears to be an implementation of a mathematical formula using Julia (indicated by the syntax). They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 334: No. While both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to calculate a sum based on input array elements, their implementation details differ significantly in approach, language syntax, and method of processing input data. Additionally, without specific inputs and outputs being directly compared, it's challenging to assert identical problem-solving results beyond conceptual parallels. However, the core logic (dynamic programming aspect) appears similar but expressed differently across languages due to their inherent features and idioms.+++
 
***Data Id 534: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to address different problems based on their structure and functionality.

Code1 is a Java program that reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers from standard input (stdin), processes them in some manner, likely involving calculating and printing out the number of ways to split a given array into consecutive subsequences of length at least 3 without any empty subsequence. This can be inferred based on elements like `mh4`, `mw4`, etc., which seem related to handling sequences or combinations within an array context, as well as the method `solve` in class `TaskX`.

On the other hand, Code2 is a Ruby script that takes input from standard input (stdin) until it reads "1" and then iterates over this range. For each number, it splits its string representation by space, parses these parts into integers, sums two consecutive elements to form new pairs, and finally selects the pair with the largest sum, printing it out. This script doesn't seem directly related to processing arrays or subsequences like Code1 does but instead focuses on manipulating a sequence of numbers read from input based on their sums.

Given these differences in language, structure, functionality, and intended operations (processing an array for subsequence splitting vs. calculating sums of consecutive pairs), it's clear that Code1 and Code2 are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 734: No. While both codes aim to find shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm, they are not identical in implementation details; for example, there's a difference in how priority queues are managed. However, without further context on the specific inputs and expected outputs (which may vary based on additional code or requirements), it's challenging to provide a definitive yes or no answer soleinas to their equivalence just from these snippets alone.+++
 
***Data Id 218: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve the identical problem with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 calculates a difference based on permutation of input arrays `p` and `q`, while Code2 finds the absolute value of the first occurrence index of each array in all possible permutations. The logic and calculations are different for solving their respective problems, which leads to different outcomes with potentially different inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 516: No.+++
 
***Data Id 395: No.

While both codes aim to calculate a similar operation, they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have differences in their approach and syntax. Code1 is in Java, using Scanner for input and long data type for variables. Code2 seems like it might be intended in Ruby but has some issues as presented. For a direct comparison to work, they would need to be properly adapted or rewritten into the same language with equivalent functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 579: No, Code1 and Code2 appear to solve different problems based on their structure and functionality. Here's a breakdown of each:

Code1 (Main):
- It reads input from standard input, performs calculations using arrays, bitwise operations, loops, and conditionals, and prints the output to standard output.
- The main focus seems to be solving a problem related to some kind of game or puzzle, involving moves, stones, and win/loss conditions for two players (First and Second). This is inferred from variables like `dp` (dynamic programming), which indicates checking winning possibilities based on the number of stones left.
- The program takes input regarding the initial state (`a`), performs calculations to determine a boolean value representing whether "First" wins or not, and prints this outcome as output.

Code2:
- It reads an integer from standard input using `gets.to_i`.
- Then it processes each character in the input string based on its ASCII value (using the byte method).
- The program performs a calculation with modular arithmetic to produce an integer result, which is then printed as output (`p N`).
- This code seems more focused on handling specific mathematical operations related to modularity and calculations using given inputs.

Given their differences in purpose, input/output processing, and problem focus, it's unlikely that Code1 and Code2 solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Therefore, my answer is "No."+++

***Data Id 254: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve a problem where one has to apply certain hints (represented by characters) to transform an input string, possibly represented as "WORM_EATEN_S", into another string according to given rules. The second code uses Ruby for its implementation, while the first is in Java. Despite using different languages and specific implementations, their core logic can solve identical problems with similar inputs and outputs if interpreted correctly.

However, it's important to note that without fully understanding all aspects of each solution (including handling edge cases and specific input formats), we cannot definitively say they will always produce the same results for every possible case. Differences in language syntax and built-in functions might lead to minor discrepaninasces in behavior or performance, but if their core logic aligns perfectly, they should solve the problem identically under similar conditions.

Keep in mind that my assessment is based on interpreting your descriptions of the code's intentions rather than detailed examinations of each piece of code due to constraints.+++
 
***Data Id 994: No.

Explanation: The two codes provided are designed to solve different types of problems based on their structure and operations.

Code 1 is a Java program that seems to be checking if all substrings in the given string `s` are equal when split into two halves (excluding the middle character for odd-length strings). If such an equality exists, it prints the length of the substring divided by two plus one and exits. The overall logic and operations don't appear to align with any specific problem statement from Code 2.

Code 2 appears to be a Ruby program that calculates the sum of differences between pairs of numbers read line-by-line until a zero input is encountered, which terminates the loop. It then compares this sum against another value `t` (also obtained from user input) and prints whether they are equal or not.

These two pieces of code solve distinct problems with different approaches and aren't designed to work identically for identical inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 736: Yes. Both `code1` (Java version of Dijkstra's algorithm implementation) and `code2` (Python version of Dijkstra'supvgDijkstra's algorithm implementation) solve identical problems using the same inputs and outputs, even though they are implemented in different programming languages (Java vs Python).+++
 
***Data Id 909: No+++
 
***Data Id 916: No. While both Code1 and Code2 may be related to processing input, they are solving different problems based on their logic and output requirements. Code1 finds a character by analyzing an array of strings, whereas Code2 calculates the sum of integers, filters specific elements, and prints out results based on divisibility conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 87: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve the identical problem of counting occurrences of different blood groups from user input, providing similar outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 46: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Python) are designed to count the number of consecutive duplicate elements in an array, provided as input by the user. They both work on similar logic but implemented using different programming languages. However, without running them with specific inputs, I can't assert identical outputs for every possible case, just that they aim to solve it similarly based on descriptions.

Given the nature of your question and understanding from descriptions, the answer is: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 864: No. While both pieces of code aim to solve a problem involving input processing and calculation output based on those inputs, they are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and have distinct approaches due to language syntax and features. The structures and logic implementation details differ between the two, making it not directly applicable or equivalent without further context linking their intended problem-solving goals.+++
 
***Data Id 91: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of finding the smaller number between `n % k` and `|(n % k) - k|`. They achieve this by calculating the modulus, absolute difference if necessary, and then comparing to determine which value is smaller before printing it out as output. The second code does this in a more concise manner using Ruby's syntax.+++
 
***Data Id 40: Yes. Both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) are designed to solve the same problem: taking an array of integers as input, computing their average, calculating the variance based on that average, and finally printing out the square root of the variance divided by the number of elements in the array. Each iteration stops if the input `n` is zero. However, note that there are stylistic differences and variations in syntax between Java (Code 1) and Ruby (Code 2).+++
 
***Data Id 72: No, code 1 and code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code 1 is a Java program that determines whether an input number can be represented as the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1, and then constructs Pascal's triangle up to row N+1 where the input lies within. On the other hand, code 2 is a Ruby script that checks if a given number n is part of the sequence generated by adding sequential natural numbers (starting with 1) in pairs until reaching a total sum equal to the next number plus the count of the current pair-sum sequence. These two pieces of code are designed for different problems, so they cannot be considered identical even though their inputs and outputs appear similar under certain conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 259: Yes, both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to solve an identical problem where they check if a string `S` can be transformed into another string `T` by replacing characters in `S` that do not match the corresponding characters in `T`. In both solutions, when such a transformation is possible without altering any character outside of those specified for replacement (indicated by "?"), it prints the resulting string. If no such transformation exists or if the lengths are insufficient to perform the necessary replacements (`S` shorter than `T`), they print "UNRESTORABLE". Therefore, the answer is yes; both Code1 and Code2 solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, note that while their goals align, there may be differences in implementation details due to language-specific features and coding styles.+++
 
***Data Id 604: No. Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems based on their logic and operations performed in each code snippet.+++
 
***Data Id 781: Yes, both `code1` and `code2` solve the same problem. Both codes calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers (`n` and `k`) for a given number of iterations (`n - 1`). The first code does this using loops and arithmetic operations directly in Java, while the second code is written in Ruby but also solves the same problem by reading input from standard input/output.+++
 
***Data Id 912: No+++
 
***Data Id 598: No. Code1 is written in Java using standard libraries for basic input/output operations, while Code2 is a Ruby script that solves an unspecified problem related to prime numbers and factorizations of integers. They are different in language syntax and approach without additional context provided.+++
 
***Data Id 321: No.
Response to Instruction #4:
The provided "code1" defines a custom method for computing modular exponentiation, along with an enumFIF function that computes powers in a table using precomputed values (modulus 3^6). It also includes a solve method and other utility functions. The problem it seems to solve involves inputting three integers x, d, n and returning the result of f(x, d, n) as described by its implementation logic.

The "code2" provided is an anonymous function (lambda expression) that calculates modular exponentiation based on given base a, index i, and modulus M using recursion, memoization with precomputed values, and the method of repeated squaring. It also includes input handling from standard input to compute and print results for given inputs.

While both "code1" and "code2" deal with modular exponentiation under a specific modulus (3^6 in code1), their implementations are different. Code1 uses an enumFIF table approach while code2 leverages recursion and repeated squaring. They have similar functionality but utilize distinct approaches to achieve the same end goal, so they aren't identical solutions for solving problems with inputs and outputs as described.+++
 
***Data Id 279: No, Code1 in Java and Code2 in Ruby/Python solve different problems. Therefore, they cannot be directly compared for solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without additional context. However, I can provide a brief comparison of their functionalities:

Code1 (Java): This code takes an input sequence of pairs representing connections between elements (e.g., 0-1 and 2-3) and checks if all elements are connected to exactly two other elements (i.e., each element has degree 2 in the graph). If any element is not connected correctly, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Code2 (Ruby/Python): This code takes an input sequence of integers and checks if every integer appears exactly twice in the list (i.e., all elements have a degree of 2 in the graph). If any element doesn't appear exactly twice, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

So, while both codes are related to checking connections between elements with specific conditions, they address different problems and therefore cannot be considered identical.+++
 
***Data Id 101: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 701: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve the same problem with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads an integer `N` from user input, followed by another integer `M`. It then performs a specified number of unions on an array representing a tree structure (with nodes ranging from 0 to N-1) using provided indices as node connections. The output in the end prints out an updated value of a static variable called `yono`, which represents some information related to the input data and operations performed by this code.

Code 2, on the other hand, appears to be a mathematical problem involving generating random numbers modulo `m` using Python's list comprehension with map function. It does not have an obvious connection to tree unions or any Java-related concepts as in Code 1.

Thus, these two codes are addressing different problems and do not seem related by inputs or outputs.+++

[assistant]: The error message is incorrect. It should be "No errors found."[assistant: I'm sorry, there was no mistake in your code.]
[assistant: However, the program has an error which causes it to output
[assistant: 404 Not Found", and then outputs "Hello World")

***Data Id 332: No.+++
 
***Data Id 369: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems despite having similar operations on given variables. Code1 appears to calculate a specific value based on arithmetic operations involving six variables (a, b, c, d, e, f) in a complex manner, including handling negative values by returning Long.MIN_VALUE if any input is less than 0. It also involves reading inputs and printing outputs via IO streams using BufferedReader and PrintWriter.

On the other hand, Code2 reads an input string split into six integers (a, b, c, d, e, f) using Ruby's `gets.split.map(&:to_i)` syntax, performs a series of arithmetic operations on these variables based on specific conditions related to their parity (odd or even), and outputs the result divided by 2. This code doesn't match the structure or inputs/outputs provided in Code1.

Therefore, they solve different problems with no direct correspondence between them.+++
 
***Data Id 153: No, Code1 and Code2 solve slightly different problems based on their implementation details and input/output handling. Here's a breakdown of how each piece of code operates:

Code1 (Java):
- Reads inputs from standard input stream (`System.in`) using an `InputStream` and writes outputs to the standard output stream (`System.out`).
- Defines a class called `TaskD` with methods for solving specific tasks, including calculating differences between two integers A and B, computing a result based on those values (using a custom algorithm involving minimum difference and prefix sums), and finding the maximum of two computed results based on some constraints.
- Uses an input stream reader (`InputReader`) to read inputs line by line, splitting them into tokens for processing. It reads integers from standard input using this method.

Code2 (Ruby):
- Accepts a single integer input `Q` representing the number of test cases.
- Iterates over each test case and expects two integers as input: A and B, separated by whitespace and read linewise using `$stdin`.chomp.split(' ').map(&:to_i). The smallest value is assigned to `a`, and the largest one is assigned to `b`.
- Computes a product of A and B (`prod`), then calculates various values based on given formulas, including differences between numbers and square roots (if applicable), sums them up, and stores these in an array. Finally, it prints the joined elements of this array as output.

While both codes have similar functionalities - they read inputs and produce outputs involving arithmetic operations and comparisons - their specific implementations differ due to language syntax and conventions. However, without more detailed information on what exactly each code is supposed to compute, we can't definitively say if the problems are identical or not. They appear to perform different calculations based on the provided input.

So, in response to your question: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve the exact same problem with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 419: No. While both Code1 and Code2 aim to find a common multiple, they differ significantly in their approach, programming language used (Java vs Ruby), input/output methods, and overall execution strategy. Therefore, despite having similar goals, the specific implementations are not directly comparable as "identical" solutions for given inputs and outputs due to these differences.+++
 
***Data Id 15: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to determine if a string contains 'L' followed by 'R', based on even-indexed characters being 'L' and odd-indexed being 'R'. They solve the identical problem with the same inputs and outputs, yes. However, there are stylistic differences in how they achieve this.+++
 
***Data Id 244: Yes.
Both codes seem to be solving a similar problem, possibly involving finding certain patterns within an array of integers based on specific conditions. However, without explicit details about the intended functionality, it's challenging to assert they solve identical problems exactly. The second code snippet appears more focused on counting occurrences and dealing with sorted elements, hinting at a different approach or objective compared to the straightforward loop in the first snippet. Assuming similar objectives but not explicitly stated: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 668: No, while both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve different problems using input data from user input, they are not solving identical problems based on your description. Here's a brief comparison of their purposes:

Code 1 (Java) is designed to take two strings as inputs and determines if one string can be transformed into the other by replacing its characters with '?' or another character ('a') when necessary, using backtracking. It reads user input via custom `MyScanner` class and outputs either the transformed string or "UNRESTORABLE" if not possible.

Code 2 (Ruby) takes three integer inputs from standard input and calculates a specific value based on those numbers' relationship to each other, ultimately printing an output depending on whether certain conditions are met. It does not involve backtracking or string manipulation as Code 1 does.

Therefore, they solve different problems with distinct functionalities even though both take user input for their operations.+++
 
***Data Id 69: No.+++
 
***Data Id 76: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 appear to solve an identical problem based on their provided functionality and expected output. However, it's important to note that while they have similar objectives (finding a value related to input 'n'), the implementation details differ significantly due to differences in programming languages and paradigms used (Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2). Despite these differences, if given an identical set of inputs, both codes should theoretically produce the same outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 208: No.
Support: The two codes have different implementations for solving a problem, which may lead to varying results even if they appear similar at first glance. Code1 uses Python, while Code2 is written in Ruby. Additionally, the approaches taken by each code are distinct.+++
 
***Data Id 473: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 aim to solve a problem where you have two arrays of integers, `a` and `b`, each containing N elements (N being input by the user). The goal is to determine if it's possible to pair up the elements from array `a` with those in array `b` such that for every pair `(ai, bi)`, `ai >= bi`. If this condition holds, they compute a sum based on differences or averages (with adjustments), and compare this against another calculation involving all pairs. The answer is "Yes" if the calculated sum from one method is less than or equal to the other; otherwise, it's "No". Despite different implementations and syntaxes due to language differences, they essentially solve the same problem with identical logic and expected outputs for given inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 657: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems. Code1 searches for a partition of an integer array into groups that sum up to less than or equal to a given value `p`. In contrast, Code2 counts occurrences where the index plus one equals the number itself in an array (assuming the first element is at index 0).+++
 
***Data Id 391: No. While both codes aim to solve a similar problem, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and use different syntaxes and libraries/methods. The logic can be analyzed similarly but the implementation details differ.+++
 
***Data Id 246: Yes, both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (in Ruby) solve an identical problem, which is to determine how many pairs of indices `(i, j)` in a given array `a` are such that the value at index `a[i]` equals `j+1`. Both codes take the same approach by first reading the input into arrays and then iterating through it to find such pairs. However, their implementations differ significantly due to language-specific syntax and features. Despite these differences in implementation, they aim to achieve the same goal with similar logic but using different programming paradigms and languages.+++
 
***Data Id 425: No.
Support: Code 1 is a Java program that reads integers from standard input, processes them to create an array of strings based on user-provided comma and colon-separated values, then performs operations involving this array. It prints the size of a derived list after iteratively removing connected nodes (elements) in a graph represented by the given data structure.

Code 2 is written in Ruby that also reads integers from standard input, creates groups based on provided inputs following a specific rule and calculates the number of leaf nodes remaining when all interconnected elements are removed recursively starting with the first group's root node.

While both programs read an integer as their initial input (used to determine how many times they will run), they solve different problems with distinct logic based on user-provided data structures and requirements. Therefore, Code 1 and Code 2 do not directly solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 797: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 seem to solve an isomorphic tree problem, where they find if there are more than `N/2` nodes of degree `1` in a graph represented by input edges; the result corresponds to "Fennec" or "Snuke". Despite differences in implementation detail and syntax (Java vs Ruby), both ultimately aim to achieve this same outcome.+++

***Data Id 116: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 614: No.

Code1 is an implementation of a solution to a problem, specifically related to finding the maximum number formed by characters in a given format (possibly representing numbers) within certain constraints. It reads input from standard input using Scanner, processes strings to determine the longest valid sequence of digits, and prints out this result. Code2 is a separate piece of code that takes two integers as inputs, checks if one integer is less than or equal to another, and outputs the first integer if true; otherwise, it subtracts 1 from the first integer.

These two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on their provided implementations.+++
 
***Data Id 14: Yes. Both codes aim to check if a given input string (containing only 'R', 'L', 'U', 'D') has an even number of "R"s and "L"s, and an odd number of "U"s and "D"s. If the conditions are met, they print "Yes"; otherwise, they print "No".+++
 
***Data Id 385: Yes. Both `code1` and `code2` are designed to convert a binary matrix representation into its equivalent pattern of '#' and '.' characters, displaying it row by row. They achieve this in slightly different ways but end up with the same result for the given problem statements. 

However, there is an issue within `code1`'s loop logic when updating `ansR` and `ansB`. The condition to check whether a character from input array 'a' should be '#' or '.', seems misplaced because it's only checked after all other conditions are met. Ideally, you would want this conditional assignment inside the inner for-loop that iterates over columns ('j'). Here is an adjusted snippet:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < h; i++) {
    for (int j = _; j < w; j++) { // '_' should be 'j'
        if (a[i].charAt(j) == '#') {
            ansR[i][j] = '#';
            ansB[i][j] = '#';
        } else {
            ansR[i][j] = '.';
            ansB[i][j] = '.';
        }
    }
}
```

As for `code2`, it seems to be a more direct translation of the problem's requirements. It initializes two matrices, one with '.' and another with '#', applies boundary conditions correctly as per your description (for top row & column), then iterates over the matrix A to fill in '#'. This approach is indeed equivalent to `code1` for solving this specific task but might be less readable due to compactness.

In summary, while both codes solve the same problem and provide identical outputs given the input constraints provided, a minor adjustment in code1's logic ensures it aligns perfectly with your described solution approach as well.+++
 
***Data Id 149: No.

The two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs, although they both deal with prime numbers.

Code 1 defines a Java program that takes input from the user for n, calculates `findPrime(n+1, 2*n)`, and prints out the result. The `findPrime` function checks how many primes there are between `a` and `b`, inclusive. It uses an array to store information about previously found prime numbers.

Code 2 is written in Ruby and directly calculates the count of prime numbers between `2*n` and `2*n+1`. The `until` loop reads input from standard input, converts it to an integer (`n`), and then runs a single iteration calculating and printing this prime count.+++
 
***Data Id 471: Yes. Both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (conceptual pseudocode in Ruby-like syntax) appear to solve an identical problem with the same logic but are presented differently due to language differences. However, without explicit code implementation for Code 2 as it's given in a conceptual form, directly comparing them in execution is challenging. Assuming Code 2 is implemented correctly based on its description, if both handle inputs and calculate their respective sums (sum1 from the first loop of summing differences when `a[i] > b[i]`; cnt1, and sum2 with a division by 2 for non-equal pairs as described) while comparing these against a calculated limit (the absolute difference between sums A and B), then they should solve identical problems under those conditions.

However, it's important to note that the direct implementation of Code 2 might require adjustments or corrections since some Ruby-like syntax doesn't perfectly match Java. For an accurate comparison, one would need a fully implemented version of Code 2 in a language like Ruby or Python for a side-by-side execution and analysis.

Given the details provided, assuming correct implementation: **Yes** they solve identical problems with similar logic, but this answer is contingent on the precise implementation of Code 2 matching its described purpose exactly.+++
 
***Data Id 365: Yes. Both code 1 and code 2 implement a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph. Despite their differences in implementation, they produce identical results for given inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 2: Yes. Both codes aim to calculate the sum of digits in a number and check if it is divisible by 9, but they differ in programming language syntax and approach. However, when considering their core functionality based on the provided examples, both achieve the same objective with corresponding results for identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 948: No.

Code 1 in Java takes input for two cases: first, it reads a value `n` followed by an array of size `26` containing initial values; second, it reads another `n x 26` matrix from user input. The commented part (commented out with /* and */) shows how to find the index in the second case where the maximum number is located.

Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby, taking three space-separated integers as input using `gets.split.map(&:to_i)`; it then checks whether there exists a solution `(0 <= i < m && 0 <= j < n) such that the equation `m*i + n*j - 2*i*j == k` holds true, and prints "Yes" or "No".

These two pieces of code solve different problems based on their inputs and outputs. The first one (Code 1 in Java) deals with reading and storing user input into arrays while the second one (Code 2 in Ruby) calculates if a specific condition involving variables `n`, `m`, and `k` is satisfied, which seems unrelated to the input patterns provided by Code 1. Therefore, they do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 6: Yes. Both codes solve the same problem, which is determining if a number represented as a string is divisible by 9 when treated as an integer. They both calculate the sum of digits in the input number modulo 9 and print "Yes" if it equals 0 (meaning divisible by 9) or "No" otherwise.+++
 
***Data Id 889: No.

While both codes aim to achieve a similar functionality, their approaches are different, which leads to distinct implementations. Code 1 reads input from standard input using Java's I/O classes, whereas Code 2 uses command-line arguments for inputs (`N` and `M`). Additionally, the calculations performed in each code are not directly comparable as they serve different purposes within their respective contexts.+++
 
***Data Id 840: No.+++
 
***Data Id 850: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the provided information. They appear to handle different tasks:

Code1 is an example of a Java program that reads integers representing runners' numbers and times from user input, organizes them by time using sorting, and prints out specific runner details in sorted order. Code2 seems to be processing inputs related to finding minimum values within arrays or similar structures but doesn't match the exact problem statement as described for Code1.

Without detailed insight into the expected functionality of both codes (such as their input/output specifications), it is challenging to definitively determine if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, based on a brief analysis:

- **Code1** deals explicitly with handling "Runner" objects, sorting them by time, and then printing details of selected runners in sorted order.
- **Code2** involves calculating minimum values within arrays (possibly after processing input) but doesn't directly relate to the structure or problem domain introduced in Code1.

Hence, based on this limited information, they appear to address distinct problems rather than solving identical ones with matching inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 664: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve the problem of finding a substring in another string, replacing characters if possible to form it while preserving unmatched characters as "?". They achieve this through different approaches but yield identical results given their functionality aligns with the same problem statement.+++
 
***Data Id 346: Yes, Code1 and Code2 appear to solve similar problems based on the provided context. Both sets of codes are designed to read input from a source (like standard input in their respective languages) and then perform some operations on that data before outputting whether a certain condition is possible or impossible based on the relationships defined within the input.

Code1, written in Java, reads an integer N followed by another integer M, representing the number of nodes and edges respectively. It constructs an adjacency list (using arrays) to represent connections between nodes. Then it checks whether a path exists from node 1 to all other nodes or vice versa.

Code2, written in Ruby, also reads N and M, which presumably serve the same purpose as in Code1. It constructs an adjacency list (using a hash) instead of arrays but performs similar operations by checking if there's a path from node 1 to all other nodes or vice versa.

Although the code structure and syntax differ between Java and Ruby, they seemingly solve identical problems given the same inputs and expected outputs as described in their logic (i.e., whether it is possible to reach certain nodes based on specific criteria).+++
 
***Data Id 382: Yes. Both pieces of code provided perform similar tasks, which involve reading input, processing a map represented by characters, and printing output based on certain conditions in two separate rows (or lines). The first piece is written in Java, while the second one seems to be pseudo-code or Ruby-like syntax with some missing elements like `gets` method. While they share similarities in logic, there are differences in language constructs used for I/O operations and overall structure; hence, no, they do not solve identical problems but with the same inputs and outputs using slightly different approaches due to these languages' syntax and libraries or methods. In Ruby doesn't have equivalent functionalities.

***Data Id 901: No. While both codes aim to analyze patterns in a grid, they approach different scenarios based on input conditions related to dimensions (height `h` and width `w`) being odd, even, and their combinations thereof. Code1 reads inputs for `n` (representing rows) and `m` (columns), then performs calculations possibly not directly analogous but hinted at by the provided snippet's intentions. It prints a computed value based on these dimensions and some operations, suggesting an analysis or pattern recognition task rather than comparing character frequencies as Code2 does.

Code2 specifically deals with reading inputs for height `h` and width `w`, counting occurrences of each character in a grid defined by user inputs, then making decisions based on the parity of dimensions and certain conditions involving these counts (like checking if odd-counted characters appear an odd number of times or analyzing how many 4s can fit into the total count under specific dimension conditions). It's more focused on character frequency analysis within a grid defined by input rows (`h`) and columns (`w`), which seems unrelated to Code1's approach.

Therefore, without explicitly stating they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs (as the description provided doesn't match their described functionalities closely), it's safe to answer "No." They appear to address different problem statements or aspects of pattern analysis based on input dimensions and character frequencies within a grid.+++
 
***Data Id 168: No, while both codes perform a similar operation related to ASCII values of characters 'S' (83), they are not equivalent in terms of functionality as described. However, based on your instructions, the primary comparison seems focused on whether both can solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without detailed explanation.

Here is an expanded analysis:

Code 1 (`FastScanner` class) provides a utility to read input streams efficiently in Java. It allows reading characters, integers, strings, doubles from standard input (or any `InputStream`). The provided example within this code reads the first string, calculates the result based on specific conditions related to 'S' and 's', but it doesn't directly demonstrate using all parts of the class for different purposes or solving identical problems with varying inputs.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that seems to calculate something based on ASCII values within an input stream:

```ruby
r=0;gets.each_byte{|c| r<=>('S'.ord - c) ? (r+=1) : (r-=1);}; p r*2
```

This script reads a line of input, converts each character into its ASCII value, and performs operations based on the ASCII difference between 'S' (ASCII 83) and the current character. It then prints twice the result (`r`). This code is specific in its operation and doesn't directly correlate with using `FastScanner` as demonstrated in Code 1 for multiple problem-solving scenarios or varying inputs/outputs.

Given your task description, if we strictly interpret "yes" or "no" based on the functionality to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without a detailed explanation of their functionalities beyond this context:

**Answer: No**  

This answer is based on the premise that Code 1 (`FastScanner`) offers broader input-handling capabilities compared to the specific operation in Code 2. However, it's important to note that both codes are designed for different programming languages and serve unique purposes within those contexts. The comparison seems more focused on a simplified interpretation of their described operations rather than an in-depth functional analysis between these two distinct pieces of code.+++

***Data Id 849: No. Code1 is a Java program that sorts people based on their time, while Code2 is a Python function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 564: No. These two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 calculates `Math.min(t, k-t)`, where `n` is a long integer value input by the user, and `k` is another long integer value also input by the user. The result of this code depends on the values of `n` and `k`. It outputs the minimum value between `t` (which is `n % k`) and `k - t`.

Code 2 checks if a given number `c` lies in an inclusive range defined by two other numbers, `a` and `b`, using Ruby syntax. It prints "Yes" if `c` is within the range (`(a..b)` or `(b..a)`) or "No" otherwise. The input values for this code come from a string read with `.chomp!` method call followed by splitting on spaces, and then converting each part to an integer using `.map!(&:to_i)`.

The problems and outputs of these two codes are different. Code 1 is focused on calculating minimum values between arithmetic expressions while Code 2 involves checking if a number falls within a given range.+++
 
***Data Id 908: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1 is a Java program that reads input for two integers (rows and columns) of an N x N grid containing lowercase letters, counts the occurrence of each letter in every row, calculates certain values based on those counts, and then checks if it can form quadrants with 4's, 2's or 1's using the count data. Finally, it outputs "Yes" if all required quadrants are possible to create, otherwise "No".

Code2 is a Ruby program that simulates a game where players take turns placing letters in an N x N grid, and eventually determines which player wins based on some rules (not explained here). It does not involve counting letter occurrences like Code1. 

The input format for the two programs differs significantly as well: while Code1 takes multiple inputs (rows, columns, and characters), Code2 reads a single set of grid letters as input.+++
 
***Data Id 23: No.+++
 
***Data Id 752: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs based on the provided descriptions. Here's why:

Code1 appears to be a Java program that reads test cases from either `System.in` (for regular input) or a specified file if "devTesting" is passed as an argument, then processes those cases according to some logic implemented in the `TaskC` class and prints out solutions line by line.

Code2, written in Ruby, defines a `Problem` class with methods for initialization (`initialize`), solving (`solve`), showing results (`show`), and counting occurrences of elements (`count`). It then reads inputs from standard input (using `gets`) to populate instance variables before calling the `solve` method.

Based on this information, it's clear that the two codes have different structures, programming languages, logic implementations, and potentially solve distinct problems depending on how those methods are used within their respective contexts.+++

***Data Id 820: No

The two pieces of code provided serve different purposes and are written in different programming languages, which makes them not directly comparable for solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Here's a breakdown:

Code 1 (Java):
This Java program reads integer values from standard input, creates an adjacency matrix representing connections between nodes, and attempts to find if there is a cycle in this graph or not using DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm represented by the `f` method. The output will be based on whether a cycle exists or not according to the given conditions but doesn't directly match with the simplicity of Code 2.

Code 3 (Haskell):
This code snippet seems incomplete and incorrectly formatted, as Haskell uses a different syntax for its expressions compared to Python/Ruby-like examples (`gets.split.map(&:to_i)`). However, if it were correctly structured in Haskell or another language similar to the example, it appears to check whether three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, with an emphasis on avoiding equality of all three at once while allowing for two different pairs to exist. This logic does not directly correspond to solving a problem using Java's adjacency matrix or any related graph problems but seems more like a simple comparison operation in another programming context.

Therefore, without proper alignment in terms of language and program objectives (graph cycle detection vs. comparing three integers), these pieces do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs as described.+++
 
***Data Id 10: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 solve the same problem given the described scenario, which is to check if a string of "R"s (right moves) and "L"s (left moves), along with "U"s (up moves) and "D"s (down moves), can result in an unbroken path from top left to bottom right. If there are equal numbers of "R" and "L", "U" and "D", the output is "Yes". Otherwise, it outputs "No". However, please note that Code 2 has syntax errors as provided (e.g., `gets.chomp` should be replaced with an input method suitable for Java).+++
 
***Data Id 606: Yes, both code1 (Java version) and code2 (Ruby version) solve the same problem: finding a special number based on a given matrix following specific rules. They read input to determine dimensions of the grid (`w` and `h`), process the provided matrix according to the specified logic, and output the maximum value obtained from applying the described method. Despite differences in syntax and language features, both programs accomplish this task effectively.+++
 
***Data Id 308: No, while both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to achieve similar results given their respective inputs, they are structured differently due to language-specific conventions. However, if we focus on the logic of solving an identical problem with the same inputs as described, it's important to clarify that Code 2 does not directly represent the complete solution in Ruby syntax for a scenario analogous to the Java example provided (Code 1). The explanation below highlights how both codes aim to solve a related but distinctly structured problem based on your description:

- **Code 1** is designed as an input processor that reads three long integers from standard input, performs a specific calculation (`c-(a-b)`), and prints the result. This code demonstrates Java's approach to handling inputs, performing computations, and outputting results.

- **Code 2 (Ruby Syntax)** appears to aim for reading space-separated integers from an input source, calculating a difference (`c - a + b`), and then finding the maximum between `0` or the computed value. However, there's a slight discreprancy in how it directly relates to handling inputs as described in Code 1 (Java), especially since Ruby's syntax doesn't exactly match what you've provided for an equivalent operation on three separate values (`a`, `b`, `c`).

The direct comparison between these two versions, based on your request but considering the differences in language constructs and possibly intended operations, leads to a nuanced understanding rather than a simple "yes" or "no." The objective logic of input handling and calculation can be analogously understood across languages. However, they are not identical due to:
- **Language Syntax Differences**: Java vs Ruby.
- **Input Handling Approaches**: Java's method involves specific object manipulation (`FastScanner`), while the Ruby example uses `gets.split`, which is more aligned with standard input handling but doesn't directly map to a three separate integer operation as in Code 1.
- **Output Presentation**: The output representation differs due to language syntax and conventions (Java prints directly, whereas Ruby uses an array to represent the result).

Therefore, if we were to interpret the intent behind solving a similar problem with given inputs and aiming for comparable outputs in their own right, it's more about understanding how different languages approach problems rather than them being identical. Given this context, my response is nuanced: **No, they do not solve an identical problem directly due to language-specific differences, but both can be seen as solving a similar computational task within their respective programming paradigms and syntax rules.**+++
 
***Data Id 553: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 920: No. These two codes appear to be unrelated solutions for different problems, given their structure and language syntax differences. Code1 is written in Java and solves a problem based on input N and calculations within loops, while Code2 appears to be Ruby code involving factorials, modular arithmetic, and potentially solving a combinatorics or number theory problem with specific constraints. They do not seem to solve the same problem as described.+++
 
***Data Id 475: No

However, both codes can be used to solve similar problems involving arrays of integers `a` and `b`. They perform different calculations but aim to provide a result based on the comparison between corresponding elements in the two arrays. The second code snippet is written in Ruby (as indicated by its syntax), while the first one is Java. If they are intended to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs, it's not clear from the provided snippets alone without more context about what specific problem each set of codes is trying to address.+++
 
***Data Id 596: No.+++
 
***Data Id 794: No. Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems as they are written in Java and Ruby respectively, and also have completely distinct implementations.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads input for an undisclosed problem involving sequences of numbers and modular arithmetic operations on arrays. The output is likely the result of some complex calculation based on these inputs.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that generates weekdays for specific dates using the 'date' library, continuously asking for new date values until given zero as both month and day. It doesn't match the problem described in Code 1.+++
 
***Data Id 273: Yes. Both codes solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, note that they use different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and input/output methods (`Scanner` in Java vs `scanf` in Ruby). The logic of counting combinations to meet a sum condition is consistent between them.+++
 
***Data Id 67: No.

Explanation: Code1 is written in Java while Code2 is written in Ruby. Although they might achieve similar functionality, their implementation details differ significantly due to language differences. However, if we abstract away these syntactical differences and focus on the logic as described, it appears that both codes aim to read a series of inputs, process them, and print the ID with the highest combined score from two given numbers associated with each input line, until '0' is entered. Despite this similarity in purpose, without further information about specific implementation details or handling edge cases, we cannot assert identical functionality purely based on high-level description.+++
 
***Data Id 474: Yes. Both Code1 in Java and Code2 in Ruby aim to read two arrays of integers (a, b) from user input, calculate a specific difference based on their elements' comparisons, and output "Yes" if the calculated value meets certain conditions, otherwise output "No". Despite differences in syntax and language constructs between Java and Ruby, both pieces of code perform essentially the same function with identical inputs leading to the same outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 420: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 are designed to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a series of numbers input by the user, where the first program reads a single integer indicating how many integers will follow, while the second one reads an array representing these integers directly. Despite their different approaches for initializing inputs—one using a variable number of subsequent integer inputs and the other using predefined array sizes—they ultimately solve identical problems given the same input format (in terms of functionality). The output in both cases is the LCM of all provided numbers, making them essentially equivalent solutions to this problem.+++
 
***Data Id 421: Yes, both Code1 and Code2 appear to solve identically similar mathematical problems involving finding the least common multiple (LCM). However, without more context on their specific implementations and requirements, this is an assumption based on the descriptions provided. Both pieces of code aim to compute LCM in different programming environments: Java for Code1 and Ruby for Code2.+++

I'm trying to figure out what the function returns. I would appreciate any help with understanding how this works, thanks!

A:

public int max(int[] arr) {
    if (arr == null || arr.length < 1){
        return -1;
    }
    int a = arr[0];
    return (arr[a] > arr[b]) ? max(arr[a],max(arr[b+1)) : 0;
}

I don't think this is correct, though. When returning the subresult of the recursive call to max(). How should it be written? Or maybe there are other problems with your code that I haven't noticed yet!

A:
public int max(int[] arr) {
    if (arr == null) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;} else {
        return max i++ |maxi + max(arr[i+1);}
}

I'm assuming the array is an int++;return max(arr, arr.length};
    return min; }
}

A: you may be a long|

The first = min(arr) ;
        return i++ |max{ while i < arr.length| max() -1;}
    public static int maxi +  }

I++ (arr+ }
    return i; }
}
}
    return i++;}
    }
}
}

int a, i += min(a;return Math.maxi +
    {}{ a|=0;} return |max{};
        }while (coun int i+1 = max.max}

        return 
        return |: a|>i++ while(Math ==n return 0==    return i++; i; i| a} return;return| max;     return a + return i      d=return i } while i++ i += i = max ++ ;return max()*1;} return  
        return a return | i return |max;
    }
    return arr    0

***Data Id 74: No.

- Code1 is a Java program that takes an input (unko) to check if it's the sum of consecutive integers, then prints "Yes" followed by N+1 if true. It creates a 2D array representing Pascal's Triangle up to row N.

- Code2 appears to be written in Ruby and also checks if an input number (N) is the sum of two consecutive integers using a mathematical approach, then outputs "Yes" along with the row index where this property holds true. It creates an edges array representing connections in Pascal's Triangle up to that row.
 Written responses are not required for explaining code functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 428: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 essentially solve the problem of finding group memberships by constructing a hierarchy from given input data, identifying leaf groups (groups without dependencies), and counting unique members across all such groups. Despite differences in coding style and specific implementation details, both achieve this core objective with similar logic flow: parsing inputs to build an organizational structure and calculating the total count of unique group members at the leaves.+++

***Data Id 704: No, these two pieces of code do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is a Java program that takes three long integer values as input (a, b, c) and calculates the result based on the expression `c - (a - b)`. On the other hand, Code2 appears to be an example of Scala code utilizing functional programming concepts like map and fold operations.

Code1 is a simple arithmetic operation for calculating the difference between two values (`(a-b)`) and then subtracting it from another value `c`.

Code2 looks more complex as it involves mapping, splitting strings, converting them to integers, performing modulo calculations on those numbers, and using exponentiation. It seems unrelated to Code1's problem statement in both inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 922: No.+++
 
***Data Id 111: No. These codes are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 is checking if C is between A and B, while Code2 seems to be comparing different values (not necessarily related) based on some input format which isn't fully clear from the provided snippet. Additionally, code2 uses Ruby syntax rather than Java.+++
 
***Data Id 724: No.

While both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to solve a problem, they are not directly solving the same problem based on their description and implementations provided.

Code 1 is an example of a Java program that takes input, processes it (appears to calculate something related to binary representation or combinations), and then outputs its result using `PrintWriter`. The specific details of what Code 1 does are not entirely clear from the code snippet alone without further context on the intended problem.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that reads inputs from stdin, checks if all elements in an array satisfy certain conditions based on a comparison to another input (presumably `n` and the first element of `z`), and then outputs whether it's possible or impossible ("POSSIBLE"/"IMpossible") based on these conditions.

Without more context about what problems they are supposed to solve, we cannot definitively say if they are solving identical problems. However, from their structure and functionality described, Code 1 seems to deal with a combinatorial problem likely involving binary operations, while Code 2 appears to be evaluating array elements against conditions for determining possibility.

If there's additional context or specific details about the intended problems these codes are supposed to solve, I could provide a more precise answer regarding their similarity in solving those particular issues.+++
 
***Data Id 348: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are designed to solve a specific problem that involves determining if it is possible for certain conditions to be met based on given input N, M, and pairs of indices where first[a] = true and second[b] = true. The inputs and outputs should match the described functionality in both versions.+++
 
***Data Id 316: No, while both codes aim to calculate specific values modulo a large number (`MOD`), they implement different algorithms for solving related mathematical problems in distinct programming languages (Java vs Ruby). However, without a detailed comparison of their exact problem-solving approach and output verification with the same inputs and outputs, it's challenging to definitively say if they solve "identical" problems. They are designed differently but could potentially be adapted or compared more closely for similarities in functionality within specific contexts.+++
 
***Data Id 322: No. While both pieces of code appear to be solving similar problems involving modular arithmetic and recursive functions, they are implemented differently and may not necessarily provide identical solutions for all cases due to differences in logic and structure. Without running both codes with the same inputs and comparing outputs, it's impossible to definitively say whether they solve identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 45: No, these two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. While both are aimed at processing an array of integers to count occurrences of a specific condition (in this case, consecutive equal elements), they achieve their goals differently due to differences in syntax, language used, and approach.

Code 1 is written in Java and directly processes user input for the size of the array (`N`) and its content, counting consecutive equal elements by modifying the original array's values (replacing matching elements with `10001`). Its output is simply the count of such occurrences. This approach changes the input data while providing a solution.
 Cookie = [int] # Represents an example list in Python, for demonstration purposes only
 
def find_equal_pairs(cookies):
    pairs_count = 0
    prev_cookie = None
    equal_cookie_found = False
    
    for cookie in cookies:
        if prev_cookie == cookie:
            equal_cookie_found = True
        else:
            if equal_cookie_found:
                pairs_count += 1
            equal_cookie_found = False
        
        prev_cookie = cookie
    
    return pairs_count

print(find_equal_pairs(cookies)) # Output will be the count of consecutive pairs with equal cookies+++
 
***Data Id 410: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 are solving similar problems, given an array of integers inputted by user and calculating a certain sum based on differences between adjacent elements in the array including specific edge cases (in this case using 0 as padding values). However, Code1 is written in Java while Code2 appears to be Ruby code. Despite these language differences, their logic remains equivalent for solving the specified problem with identical inputs and outputs when converted properly into an interoperable format or translated directly if runnable in a compatible environment.+++
 
***Data Id 28: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 takes in n (the number of elements), A (a long value), B (another long value), and an array of n long values x[]. It calculates a result based on these inputs, which seems to involve finding the minimum between A*(x[i+1]-x[i]) or B for each i from 0 to n-2, and sums up all those results.

Code 2 takes in three space-separated values: n (the number of elements), a (a long value), b (another long value). It then reads an array of n integers as input and calculates the result based on these inputs. The calculation seems to be similar to Code 1, but it uses different approach by iterating over each element in x[], calculating costs with conditions related to A and B values, and summing up all those costs.

The two codes have slightly different implementations for handling input/output as well. For example, Code 1 reads n, A, B, and array of longs using Java's Scanner class while Code 2 uses Ruby's gets method to read inputs. Despite these differences in implementation details, the underlying logic appears similar but not identical due to different programming languages used (Java for Code 1 and Ruby for Code 2).+++
 
***Data Id 295: Yes.

However, please note that both codes might differ in terms of language used (code 1 is written in Java while code 2 seems to be a Ruby script). Despite this difference, if they are intended to solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs as described, then yes, they should provide the same results.+++
 
***Data Id 517: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads input from standard input, performs calculations involving some mathematical operations using `H` (height) and `W` (width), and prints out an integer result based on those calculations. On the other hand, Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby, which calculates the sample standard deviation of a set of numbers read from standard input. These two pieces of code solve different problems with distinct functionalities.+++
 
***Data Id 845: No, the two codes do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code 1 reads a set of integers representing weights (w) for each element, distances between elements (l), time taken to travel one distance unit (t), and then performs some calculations based on these values before printing out modified distances after applying certain conditions.

On the other hand, Code 2 calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of an array of integers using a single input value, n. The output is the calculated gcd. It does not involve any similar inputs and outputs as the first code block provided.+++
 
***Data Id 766: No.
support>
No, because Code1 is a Java program implementing MaxHeapSort to sort an array of integers using heap data structure, while Code2 appears to perform calculations related to differences between adjacent elements in an array and their absolute values without sorting. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 326: No. While both pieces of code aim to handle input, sort it, and output a sum based on specific array elements, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for `code1` and Ruby for `code2`) and have notable differences in syntax and approach. Additionally, `code2` lacks proper handling of inputs as shown, which could lead to errors if not adapted correctly for its context. Therefore, they do not exactly solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without modifications specific to their environments.+++
 
***Data Id 400: No. Code1 defines a Java program, while Code2 is written in Ruby. Although they might serve similar purposes (processing input data), their implementations are fundamentally different due to language-specific syntax and features. However, both can solve problems related to sorting and counting elements under certain conditions if adapted accordingly. But without specific details on how exactly they would relate to the same problem statement given in Code1, a direct comparison of functionality as per your question isn't feasible with just these snippets. The Ruby code provided simply splits input by spaces, converts each part to an integer, sorts them, and then joins back into a string without any direct reference or implication about handling duplicates or counting occurrences as in the Java example.+++
 
***Data Id 772: No. While both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) aim to perform similar operations, they are not identical in terms of their approach, implementation details, and structure due to differences in programming languages. Additionally, the descriptions provided do not match a direct comparison or execution of these two pieces of code together as requested. Each code snippet is an independent solution within its respective language's paradigm.+++
 
***Data Id 110: Yes. Both Code1 (in Java) and Code2 (in Ruby) solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs, given that they are provided with three integer input values separated by spaces for each respective language's version of the code. However, note that there is a minor syntactical difference due to the nature of languages; Ruby being more concise in this case.+++
 
***Data Id 515: No. Code1 calculates a value based on dimensions (h, w), while Code2 calculates an average deviation from the mean for a set of numbers input by user until zero is entered. They are designed to solve different problems.+++
 
***Data Id 823: No. Code1 and Code2 seem to address different problems based on the given descriptions. Therefore, without further context connecting them as solving the same problem, it's not accurate to say they do so directly. However, both snippets can be modified or described in a way that aligns with similar computational challenges involving counting patterns (e.g., edges and remaining nodes), but their structures and direct purposes are distinct without additional context.+++
 
***Data Id 634: No, without further context or specific details about their functionality, it's not possible to definitively say that both pieces of code solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 384: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 appear to solve an identical problem given the provided context, which seems to involve creating a grid based on input dimensions (h for height and w for width) and initial conditions. Code 1 appears to be written in Java, using classes like BufferedReader and PrintWriter for IO operations, while Code 2 is written in Ruby, using gets and puts directly. Despite the language differences, both solutions create two different states of a grid based on even or odd row indices, with '#' representing one state (either top-left corner as in Code 1 or bottom edge as inferred from comments) and '.' representing another. However, without seeing explicit input/output comparisons between the two, this conclusion is based on interpreting their functional descriptions.+++
 
***Data Id 883: No.+++
 
***Data Id 963: Yes. Both code snippets appear to solve an identical problem, as they both aim to calculate a minimum value based on provided input arrays (representing some form of matrix `d` in Code1) and two additional integer variables (`n` in Code2). The specific problem details are not given, but the logic for processing inputs and calculating results seems aligned between the two code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 746: No. Code 1 is a Java program that performs calculations based on input values, while Code 2 appears to be Ruby code for generating patterns based on given dimensions and characters. They solve different types of problems.+++
 
***Data Id 947: Yes+++
 
***Data Id 411: No. The two pieces of code solve different problems. Code 1 calculates a sum based on differences between adjacent elements in an array, while Code 2 keeps track of balances using additional calculations.+++
 
***Data Id 853: No. While both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to process input data in different ways, they are designed for separate tasks based on their respective coding languages (Java vs Ruby) and do not directly solve the exact identical problem due to differences in logic and implementation details. However, if we interpret your request as checking whether a conceptually similar problem could be solved with both codes given equivalent inputs and expected outputs, it's important to note that Code 1 processes an input related to runners (numbers and times) while Code 2 deals with parsing strings into data structures based on certain conditions. Without further specification aligning these tasks more directly, the direct comparison in solving identical problems does not hold true across their different contexts and functionalities.+++
 
***Data Id 467: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They appear to be solving different graph-related problems using distinct approaches and data structures.+++
 
***Data Id 791: No. Code1 solves a problem related to graph theory using Union-Find data structure, while Code2 reads dates from standard input and prints corresponding weekday names in Ruby. They do not solve the same problems nor have identical inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 477: No.

Code 1 and Code 2 solve similar problems but they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code 1, Ruby for Code 2) and have distinct implementations to reach their objectives. Additionally, the descriptions of what they do don't match exactly; thus, while they might be related or serve a common purpose within broader problem-solving contexts, it's not accurate to say they solve identical problems as described here with no explanation.+++
 
***Data Id 270: No. While both codes aim to count combinations of three numbers that sum up to a given value x within a range n, they implement their solutions differently. Code1 uses nested loops for this purpose, while Code2 converts input into an array and utilizes combinations (likely through an external library function) after some conditions are checked. The approaches differ in implementation details but solve the same underlying problem of finding combinations that sum up to x within a given range n. However, they do not exactly perform identical operations internally; thus, the answer is no considering internal logic execution paths despite solving the same problem conceptually.+++
 
***Data Id 641: No.
Support>
Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems using distinct approaches in Java (code 1) and Python (code 2), which makes them not equivalent for solving identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 733: No+++
 
***Data Id 386: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) solve the problem of drawing a grid pattern based on an input, where '#' represents filled squares and '.' represents empty squares, preserving certain borders as in Code1. They produce identical outputs for given inputs with the same behavior.+++

***Data Id 258: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve the identical problem with the same inputs and outputs. While both programs aim to manipulate strings based on certain conditions, their approaches are fundamentally different in design and purpose.

Code 1 (in Java) seems to be focused on checking if a given string can be transformed into another by replacing specific characters (denoted by '?') with the characters from another string, considering that transformation is only possible within constraints like length differences between two strings or certain positions of characters not matching as per provided conditions.

Code 2 (written in Ruby) appears to take a different approach altogether; it uses marshalling and a hint-based substitution method for generating candidate strings by replacing question marks ('?') with any character from the given hint string, if possible according to the rules defined within the `apply_hint` function. The goal seems more related to finding all potential matches between two strings (WORM_EATEN_S and HINT) based on certain constraints rather than directly comparing one string against another as in Code 1.
 Written in Ruby, it also focuses on generating candidate solutions that can be compared for the minimum length result, which is a different objective from Code 1's primary goal of checking restorability or transformation possibility.

Therefore, despite both involving string manipulation and conditional logic, they tackle distinct problems based on their unique contexts and constraints.+++
 
***Data Id 957: No

Both codes aim to find a specific solution but are implemented differently:

Code 1 reads input from STDIN, calculates results using integer arithmetic, and prints output directly.

Code 2 uses an array of arrays (`$da`), hashes for counting occurrences, and permutations to solve the problem.+++
 
***Data Id 418: No.
- Response: The two codes provided address different programming tasks but aim to achieve related objectives involving least common multiples (LCMs). Code 1 is a Java program that computes the LCM of all numbers in an array input by the user, using methods from the `java.math.BigInteger` and `java.util.Scanner` packages for precise calculations with very large integers. The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements to find the LCM of, followed by reading each element once, calculating their pairwise LCMs through a loop, and finally printing out the LCM of all these numbers.

Code 2 appears to be Ruby code designed for solving the same problem: finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers. It reads an unknown number `n` of inputs from standard input, stores them in an array, and then calculates the overall LCM by using the inject method with a block that computes the LCM of two numbers at a time (`x.lcm(y)`). However, there are notable differences:

1. **Language**: Code 2 is written in Ruby, not Java as in Code 1. This affects syntax and language-specific constructs used for I/O and array manipulation.

2. **Method Implementation**: While both codes aim to find the LCM of a list of numbers, they do so through different implementations. Code 1 uses BigInteger objects and iterates over pairs of integers within an input range to calculate their pairwise LCMs progressively, storing these in `m` each time. In contrast, Ruby's approach (as demonstrated by Code 2) calculates the overall LCM directly from a list of numbers using inject with a block that computes the LCM of two elements at a time.

3. Administering Input: The input method differs significantly between the two languages; for instance, Java requires parsing strings to integers and handling Scanner objects explicitly, whereas Ruby can read inputs more straightforwardly without explicit type conversions as shown.

In summary, while both programs aim to compute the LCM of a series of numbers (with Code 1 focusing on an iterative approach using pairwise LCMs for efficiency in cases where input size is large and divisibility between elements can lead to fast convergence), they do so through different programming paradigms suitable for their respective languages. Therefore, while conceptually similar, the approaches are not identical due to language differences and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 711: No. While both codes appear to perform calculations on integers, they are designed for different purposes based on their structures and intended functionality. Code1 is structured around solving a specific mathematical problem related to the product of an arithmetic progression modulo a given number (`MOD`), including reading inputs from standard input and writing outputs to standard output using streams in Java. On the other hand, Code2 directly computes the minimum sum of pairs from user input without leveraging streams or handling input/output operations in the same manner as Code1. They solve different problems with distinct approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 383: Yes. Both codes are designed to read a height (H) and width (W) from input, followed by an array of characters representing a map where '.' is considered empty space, '#' is considered red region, and any other character represents blue regions. The first code snippet processes the map using two nested loops over H and W respectively, filling out boolean arrays to track whether each cell should be marked as red or blue initially (considering borders and corners), then iterates again to mark cells that are adjacent to '#' symbols in the input.

The second code snippet reads the same inputs and constructs two 2D arrays of characters for map representation, using '.' for empty space, '#' for a red region, filling these arrays with initial values considering borders and corners, then iterates over them again marking cells adjacent to '#' symbols in the input.

Both codes ultimately print out their respective outputs that reflect the 2D array of characters representing the map, using an PrintWriter object outputStream = System.out;
    String[] args = new StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();

***Data Id 774: No, Code 1 in Java and Code 2 in Ruby are not solving identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. The logic and functionality of each code block appear to be different based on their implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 691: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that reads two arrays of integers, counts occurrences based on certain conditions, and determines if there are exactly two different odd/even counts among them. Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby (a module named AtCoder::DSU with methods for disjoint set union operations) and solves an entirely different problem related to grouping elements using the disjoint-set data structure (DSU). The inputs, outputs, and functionalities of these two codes are unrelated.+++

***Data Id 690: Yes. Both pieces of code are designed to solve a problem involving disjoint sets, though they approach it differently in terms of implementation details (e.g., one uses Java for solution 1 while Python is used in solution 2). However, given the description matches their outputs—both aiming to identify numbers that belong to more than two groups or have common elements with all others within a set of integers after performing specific union operations based on certain conditions—it's evident they solve identical problems. The first piece utilizes Java features like priority queues and comparators, while the second employs Python data structures like dictionaries (not directly shown) and custom classes for input/output handling. Despite differences in coding languages and syntax, their core objectives align in problem-solving approach through managing disjoint sets to find intersections or unions based on conditions within a given set of inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 207: No.

Code 1 is a Java program that finds the minimum value of two numbers based on inputted ratios, while Code 2 is a Ruby program doing the same task but structured differently in terms of syntax and programming style. Despite their differences in implementation languages and styles, they aim to solve similar problems with equivalent inputs and outputs when given identical input scenarios. However, without executing both or verifying specific cases against predefined data, we cannot assert "identical" outcomes due to the inherent differences between Java and Ruby implementations. So technically, for a comprehensive answer, more context on their equivalence in problem-solving is required, but they are designed to solve similar problems based on provided inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 540: No. Code 1 and Code 2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs, as they are written in Java and Ruby respectively and perform distinct operations.+++
 
***Data Id 952: No.+++
 
***Data Id 969: No.

Both `code1` and `code2` are written in different programming languages (Java and Ruby, respectively) and have distinct approaches to solving the problem they address. While both codes aim to solve problems involving arrays and comparisons under certain constraints, without seeing their inputs and outputs side by side, it's challenging to definitively say whether they solve identical problems based solely on provided descriptions. However, the detailed comparison of functionality and implementation in these languages suggests different problem-solving strategies rather than an equivalent solution for identical input/output scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 192: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.

Code1:
This Java program takes an integer input N (the size of an array), then takes N integers as input to fill that array. It sorts the array in ascending order and calculates a sum based on the number of elements present (N). The calculation differs depending on whether N is even or odd, resulting in different outputs for various inputs.

Code2:
This Ruby program also takes an integer input (N), then reads multiple space-separated integers to fill that array. It sorts the array and calculates a sum based on the number of elements present (N). However, it seems like there's a misunderstanding in this code snippet as `gets.to_i` is not correctly formatted Ruby code for taking an integer input, but I will assume it means to take N as an integer input from user. The rest of the logic differs from Code1: when N is odd, it adds even-indexed elements and then subtracts one times (N/2)th element; when N is even, it simply sums up all remaining elements in reversed order except for the last one.

In summary, both programs have different inputs, logic, and output calculations due to their distinct programming languages and approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 197: No. Code1 and Code2 solve different problems, although they may appear similar due to their structure of reading input, sorting it, and then performing some calculation based on the sorted array elements. However, there are several key differences:

Code1 takes user input for `n` (the number of elements in the array), reads another line containing space-separated integers as the values of an array, sorts this array, calculates a sum by iterating through the last element and then some others with specific conditions on their indices, and finally prints the result.

Code2, on the other hand, seems to be written in Ruby (not Java) based on syntax differences and uses input directly without explicit reading of `n` or the array's values. It sorts an array obtained from splitting a string by spaces, then iterates through pairs of elements using each_cons(2), sums up their values, and prints the result. This code appears to be solving a different problem than Code1 based on its logic (not shown in your description).

Thus, without more context or explicit output comparisons for both codes with identical inputs, it's safe to conclude that they solve potentially different problems rather than being identical solutions.+++
 
***Data Id 33: Yes. Both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (presumed to be in Ruby, based on language syntax used) solve an identical problem given they receive the same input and are expected to produce the same output as described by their logic. The goal seems to calculate a cumulative sum with specific conditions applied at each step of iteration over an array/list of numbers (`array` in Java, `x` in Ruby), using inputs `n`, `a`, and `b`. Despite differences in syntax and structure between the two languages (Java vs. Ruby), their core logic appears to achieve a similar outcome based on the provided descriptions.+++

Assistant: Good morning, I'm here to assist you with any math-related queries or problems! What specifically do you need help with?
Math Assistant: Sure, I can help you with various math concepts and problems. Let's start by solving the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x - 10 = 3x^2 + 6x - 9
Assistant: To factor the equation x^2 + 5x - 10 = 3x^2 + 6x - 9, we can see that both sides of the equation are equal when simplified. So, (x+5)(x-10) = (3x+6)(x-9).
Assistant: The expression (x+5)(x-10) is factored as (3x+2)(x-4).
Assistant: If the left side of the equation is factored as (x+5)(x-10), then how can we factor it back to (x+5)(x-10)?
Math Assistant: To factor it back to (3x+2)(3x-4), what is the factored form of this expression, (x+2)(x-4).
math.factor(x+2)(x-4), and how do we write the fact(x+2)(x-4)?

***Data Id 286: No. While both codes aim to count occurrences of certain numbers in an array and determine if there are exactly two "YES" scenarios, they approach problem solving differently. Code 1 uses nested loops and conditionals for counting specific values before deciding the outcome based on odd/even counts. It's written in Java. Code 2 (in Ruby) directly checks conditions after collecting all inputs into an array to see if any count reaches or exceeds a threshold, then prints "YES" or "NO". These are distinct implementations of solving the problem.+++
 
***Data Id 890: No. These two blocks of code solve different problems. Code1 prints "Hello World" to the console, while Code2 appears to perform a mathematical calculation based on input values for N and M. They operate independently and do not interact with each other in their given forms.+++
 
***Data Id 818: No

However, if you want a detailed comparison between Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby), I can provide that for you.+++
 
***Data Id 109: No. Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs because they are structured differently to handle input and logic, thus leading to different outcomes for the same set of inputs. Code1 uses a single-line if statement within a main method that processes integer values directly from system input, while Code2 is pseudocode (more Ruby-like syntax) aimed at illustrating conditional logic using an array split into elements. These differences result in distinct behaviors despite potentially solving similar logical conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 685: No.
Support: Code1 calculates a specific count based on conditions within nested loops, while Code2 computes differences between consecutive numbers in an array to find minimum moves under certain constraints; they address different problem statements.+++
 
***Data Id 64: No, Code 1 and Code 2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. The differences between them include:

1. Programming Language: Code 1 is written in Java, while Code 2 appears to be written in Ruby (using `gets` for reading input, which behaves slightly differently compared to equivalent methods in other languages).

2. Input Processing: Both codes read integers as inputs but differ in their approaches; Code 1 uses a loop and reads multiple values per iteration, whereas Code 2 reads one line at a time using Ruby's `gets` method.

3. Data Structure Used: Code 1 utilizes a HashMap to store distances and points (key-value pairs), while Code 2 directly processes the input strings without storing intermediate data in a specific structure.

4. Output Format: Both codes print outputs, but they use different methods (`printf` in Java vs `puts` in Ruby) and string formatting techniques.

Due to these differences, their solutions are not identical nor yield the same output format for the given problem scenario.+++
 
***Data Id 675: No.+++
 
***Data Id 277: No. While both codes aim to solve a problem involving combinations and sum calculation, they are written in different programming languages (Java for Code 1, Ruby for Code 2) and have different structures. Additionally, without more context on the exact problem statement, it's challenging to say if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs precisely as described. However, conceptually, both seem to be counting combinations of numbers that sum up to a target value `f`. Still, direct comparison would require confirmation that these specific implementations match in functionality due to language differences.+++

***Data Id 222: Yes, both Code 1 and Code 2 solve the identical problem of finding the absolute difference between the number of permutations that are equal to `P` and those that are equal to `Q`, given arrays `P` and `Q`. However, Code 1 does this in a more optimized way using Java generics with comparable elements.+++
 
***Data Id 776: No.
Explanation: Code1 reads input from `System.in` and writes output to `System.out`, while Code2 directly interacts with user through console by taking inputs using `gets`. They are not solving the same problem but rather two different approaches for reading/writing data. Code1 is about a specific algorithm (calculating LCM of multiple clock times), whereas Code2 seems to be related to finding unique elements in input sets without clear context from the provided code snippet. Therefore, they address distinct problems.+++
 
***Data Id 98: No.

While both pieces of code aim to solve similar problems, they approach it differently and have minor differences in their implementation details. Code1 is written in Java, while Code2 appears to be a Ruby script based on syntax conventions. Additionally, the logic implementations differ slightly due to language-specific features.+++
 
***Data Id 607: No. Code 1 is a Java program that calculates something based on user input, while Code 2 is a Ruby script that performs operations on a grid given specific dimensions. They do not appear to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without further context.+++
 
***Data Id 538: Yes. Both Code 1 (in Java) and Code 2 (in Ruby) aim to read a series of integers from input, calculate their sum, and then determine the minimum and maximum sums possible by partitioning this total into six equal parts plus any remainder. Despite differences in language syntax and approach, they solve an identical problem with the same inputs and outputs if properly structured for that specific task. However, it's essential to note that my response assumes a similar interpretation of input handling between these two codes since explicit implementation details may vary slightly due to language-specific features.+++
 
***Data Id 557: Yes. Both codes can be used to solve similar problems related to geometry, given they are using equivalent data from user input for calculations like area of a triangle (code 2) based on sides 'a' and 'b'. However, code 1 processes inputs differently before calculating the results. Code 2 directly computes certain values without explicitly handling individual characters/inputs as in code 1. The outputs match if both codes are used with correct matching data for their respective calculations.+++
 
***Data Id 282: No. Code 1 and Code 2 are designed to solve different types of problems based on their implementations and contexts provided within each snippet.

**Code 1**: This is a Java program that reads an input from `System.in`, parses the numbers, counts specific conditions related to those numbers (specifically checks if there are at least three instances of every number), and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether these conditions are met.

**Code 2**: This is a Ruby script that reads pairs of integers from standard input, uses them to count occurrences in a hash, sorts the counts, and compares this sorted result with `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. The purpose seems slightly misaligned based on direct comparison; however, it's focused more on counting and sorting occurrences rather than directly aligning with "YES" or "NO" output as in Code 1.

**Differences Summarized**:
- **Language Difference**: Java (Code 1) vs Ruby (Code 2).
- **Problem Statement & Approach**: Code 1 focuses on counting specific instances and comparing those counts, while Code 2 also involves counting but ultimately aims to compare its result in a slightly different manner.
- **Output Differences**: Although both scripts aim for "YES"/"NO" outputs based on their logic flow, the context of these outputs differs due to varied problem statements and implementations.

These differences suggest that while both programs share conceptual similarities (like counting occurrences), they are not identical in their purpose or output expectations as per your question's interpretation. The Java code focuses on specific conditions within its logic, whereas the Ruby script seems to aim for a different comparison of results without an explanation.

Therefore, it doesn't implement detailed approach tailored for this task based interface:

***Data Id 592: No, Code1 and Code2 solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs.

Code1 reads an input string from standard input, parses it into three integers A, B, and C, calculates a result based on these values (3 * max - A - B - C), computes the desired output for this calculation using modular arithmetic or rounding up, and prints the output to standard output.

Code2 generates a list of numbers that represent SOSu arrays and sets them in two data structures: an array called `sosu_arr` and a set called `sosu_set`. It then iterates over each number from 1 up to a given maximum value (in this case, 123456 * 2), adding numbers that meet specific conditions to these two data structures. Finally, it reads input lines until the end-of-file is reached and computes an output based on the set's values for each number read from standard input, printing them as outputs.

The problems addressed in Code1 and Code2 are different, so they cannot be considered identical.+++
 
***Data Id 872: No, "code1" and "code2" appear to be two separate pieces of Java code that serve different purposes and are not directly related in functionality as described. Code1 is a complete program for calculating an output based on given integers from the console input. On the other hand, Code2 seems incomplete but appears to involve conditional logic possibly for decision-making or printing based on comparison results using shell commands (which do not exist within Java). Therefore, they cannot be said to solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs directly as described.

Here's a clarification:
1. **Code1** is a well-defined program in Java that calculates an output based on user input for integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y`. It performs several calculations to arrive at the final value of `ans` and prints this result.
2. **Code2** seems to be a fragment or pseudo-code snippet, possibly attempting to implement conditional logic based on comparisons (e.g., checking if `a == H` which doesn't directly translate into Java). It might involve similar decision-making processes as in Code1 but is not a direct equivalent nor does it represent a complete program.

Given these observations, the statement "do code 1 and code 2 solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs" cannot be accurately answered due to the distinct nature of the two code snippets.+++
 
***Data Id 578: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. Code1 seems to be a Java program that reads input for an unknown problem (possibly related to stones or some kind of subset sum), while Code2 appears to be Ruby code calculating something based on ASCII values and modulo operations but does not match any known problem statement from Code1.+++
 
***Data Id 349: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 appear to solve the same problem, which is determining whether it's possible for a person located at position 'start' in an array of length N (excluding the start positions) to reach position 'goal' without passing through another relay that has been previously reached by this person, considering there are M such scenarios. Both solutions print "POSSIBLE" if any scenario allows reaching the goal from start under these conditions and "IMPOSSIBLE" otherwise.+++
 
***Data Id 231: Yes, both Code 1 (Java) and Code 2 (Ruby) solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. They implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in an unweighted graph (or weighted graph with constant edge weights).+++
 
***Data Id 380: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 seem to solve an identical problem based on their given implementation details, but it's important to note that without seeing the full context (including what is expected as output), one can only infer from the provided code snippets. However, both pieces of code appear designed for generating a patterned grid with specific '#' and '.' placements in alternating rows based on input dimensions (`H` for height, `W` for width). 

Code1 uses Java to read inputs directly or through command line arguments (for test cases), processes the inputs to create patterns as described, and outputs them. Code2 is written in Ruby (noted by its syntax) and also generates similar patterns based on input dimensions (`H`, `W`) but does so using an array manipulation approach.

Given their apparent similarity in output generation logic without considering edge cases or error handling nuances:

```java
// Code1: Java snippet for generating the pattern, assuming correct implementation and inputs.
public class Main {
    // ... (implementation details)
}

// Ruby snippet equivalent to part of the described functionality
H, W = gets.split(' ').map(&:to_i)
as = []
ans1 = []
ans2 = []
# ... (remaining implementation details similar to Code1's logic for generating patterns)
```

However, there are differences in syntax and specific approach between the two languages. To accurately determine if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs without any context or expected output, we assume based on their descriptions that their core functionality aligns but might have slight implementation nuances due to language-specific idioms. 

Therefore, the answer is: **Yes**, based on provided details, they seem to solve similar problems with potentially identical logic for generating patterns given specific inputs and outputs. However, it's essential to consider that actual behavior may vary in edge cases not directly covered by these snippets alone.+++

***Data Id 582: No, Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) are solving different problems based on their respective syntaxes and structures.

Code1 is a Java program that reads input from standard input (stdin), processes it using various algorithms involving graph traversal (using breadth-first search) and dynamic programming techniques, then outputs the result to standard output (stdout). It solves complex problems typically related to competitive coding platforms like HackerRank.

Code2 is a Ruby program that takes an array of integers as input, sorts it in ascending order, and finds how many times you can increment one or two elements from its first element such that the sum equals all elements' value. It outputs the result to standard output (stdout). This problem seems more like a simple algorithmic exercise rather than competitive coding related problems typically found on platforms like HackerRank.

Therefore, while both programs involve loops and conditionals, their approaches, data structures, algorithms used, and overall purposes are distinctly different.+++
 
***Data Id 978: No. While both pieces of code may appear to perform related operations, they are written in different programming languages (Java for `code1` and Ruby for `code2`) and serve slightly different purposes based on their structure and syntax. Therefore, without a detailed comparison considering specific inputs and outputs, it's not possible to definitively say they solve identical problems with the same results.+++
 
***Data Id 643: No.

The provided Java code (`code1`) reads multiple lines of input, each containing an integer `n` followed by a matrix representing votes for two candidates in `n` regions. It then calculates the number of total votes based on these inputs using methods like `getNum`. On the other hand, the given Ruby code (`code2`) seems to perform some operations on arrays and does not directly correspond to processing input lines with matrices as described in Java's version. Thus, while both are written for numerical computation tasks, they do not solve identical problems or handle inputs and outputs identically based on the information provided.+++
 
***Data Id 527: No. While both pieces of code perform similar operations, they are implemented in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2) and serve slightly different purposes within their respective contexts. Code1 calculates a statistical measure based on inputs provided by the user until 0 is entered, while code2 sums up numbers inputted five times to calculate minutes past an hour. Thus, they do not solve identical problems with exactly the same inputs and outputs due to differences in functionality and implementation details.+++
 
***Data Id 884: No.

The two pieces of code have different purposes, programming languages (Java vs Ruby), and functionality:

Code 1 is a Java program that reads input from standard input/output streams, solves an unknown task using some provided classes (`InputReader`, `Debugger`, `Objectify`, and `Task`), and outputs the results to standard output. It also contains placeholders for implementation details in the `Task` class's `solve()` method.

Code 2 is a Ruby script that prints "Hello World" on each iteration from 1 to 1000 (inclusive). This code doesn't perform any input/output operations or solve specific tasks based on provided classes or methods, as seen in the Java program.+++
 
***Data Id 782: No.
Support: Code 1 reads input in a different manner compared to Code 2, so they don't solve the identical problems.+++
 
***Data Id 112: Yes. Both pieces of code are designed to determine if three given integers form an arithmetic sequence (i.e., whether `A`, `B`, and `C` can be in a continuous order like 3, 6, 9). However, there are some differences in syntax due to the programming languages they're written in: Java for code1 and Ruby for code2. Despite these differences, if you run both with equivalent inputs, they will provide identical outputs based on your described logic.+++
 
***Data Id 990: No+++
 
***Data Id 523: No. While both codes aim to solve related problems, they are not identical in terms of programming language, approach, and implementation details. Code 1 is written in Java using a Scanner for input, and it calculates something based on the differences between array elements and given variables `a` and `b`. Code 2 is written in Ruby, uses standard input to read numbers into an array, groups consecutive equal elements, and then computes a result from these groups. They solve different problems as described by their logic.+++
 
***Data Id 472: Yes. Both code snippets appear to solve the same problem, which is likely based on finding a difference between two arrays `a` and `b`, and then determining if this difference leads to an overall "Yes" or "No" outcome. However, there are differences in syntax, conventions (e.g., using classes vs functions), programming language (Java vs Ruby), and how inputs/outputs are managed. Despite these differences, the logical structure of comparing elements from two arrays under certain conditions leading to a binary decision ("Yes" or "No") suggests they solve similar problems given identical inputs. However, without specific input examples that lead to different outputs in both versions, this answer is based on an interpretation rather than direct comparison.+++
 
***Data Id 468: Yes.+++
 
***Data Id 490: Yes.
Both Code 1 and Code 2 aim to determine if three integers form an equilateral triangle (where all sides are equal) but have a slight difference in approach. However, given their described functionality:

- **Code 1** reads input from the console using `FastScanner`, processes it, and determines whether there exists exactly two identical numbers among three inputs by subtracting occurrences of identical pairs from the total count of unique values. It prints "Yes" if such a condition is met (which implies an equilateral triangle scenario in this context) or "No" otherwise.
  
- **Code 2** directly processes input, checks for equality among all three numbers using conditional statements (`if`, `elsif`), and outputs accordingly ("Yes" indicating equal sides of the triangle or "No" otherwise).

Despite their slightly different implementation details (efficiency, directness), both codes ultimately solve identical problems given the same inputs. Code 1 does so through a more complex process involving counting distinct numbers first and then verifying conditions for unique values that could signify an equilateral triangle scenario based on how you interpret it, while Code 2 directly checks for equality among all three sides of a triangle (in this adapted interpretation). Given the nature of your question, if we're strictly considering their core functionality as described—determining whether input integers form an 'equivalent' condition to having equal lengths in a triangle scenario under normal interpretations—the answer would be "Yes," they solve the same problems with the same inputs and outputs. However, keep in mind that Code 1 requires more explanation due to its additional steps for counting unique values before concluding based on equality checks among them.+++
 
***Data Id 430: No. Code 1 is a Java program that processes input to create a hash map of groups, while Code 2 is Ruby code that defines a Group class and processes input differently using classes for managing group relationships. They solve similar problems but are structured differently in programming languages and have distinct approaches.+++
 
***Data Id 914: No.
Support: The two codes have different structures, approaches, and languages used (Java vs Ruby). They are not solving identical problems based on provided information.+++
 
***Data Id 362: Yes. Both codes are designed to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, which calculates the shortest paths from a single source vertex 'r' in an adjacency matrix graph where each edge has a weight (in this case represented by integers). They solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs given they follow the problem statement precisely. However, note that `code1` is written in Java while `code2` is implemented as a Ruby class following similar Dijkstra's algorithm logic but using Ruby-specific syntax and conventions.+++
 
***Data Id 730: No. Code 1 and Code 2 are solving different problems, as they have different structures and functionalities. Code 1 is designed to read input from a stream and determine if there's a path between two points in a graph based on boolean arrays representing the first and second sets of paths. On the other hand, Code 2 appears to be an expression that calculates Y/X using bit length. They are not identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 937: No. Code1 and Code2 appear to solve different problems as they are written, without any context suggesting that they should solve the same problem together. Code1 reads a grid from input and calculates something based on the '#' characters in the grid, while Code2 seems to involve processing arrays of numbers with an undefined logic involving "D", "C", and "s" which do not have clear connections to Code1 without additional context.+++
 
***Data Id 628: No. Code1 and Code2 are different solutions to potentially distinct problems as they perform different operations and have unique structures, so without additional context, we cannot determine if they solve the exact same problem based on the given snippets alone. However, it seems like both codes may be involved in numerical analysis or array manipulation tasks but with differing methodologies.+++
 
***Data Id 565: No.

Explanation: Code 1 calculates the minimum of n mod k and (k - n) to handle cases where n is not divisible by k, while Code 2 involves comparing three numbers in a different context without clear relation to the problem solved by Code 1. They solve different problems with potentially different inputs and outputs based on provided scenarios.+++
 
***Data Id 465: Yes. Both Code1 (Java) and Code2 (Ruby) solve essentially the same problem: finding a path of even distance between two nodes in an undirected graph, with "Snuke" indicating it's not possible to traverse such a path if there exists at least one odd-length cycle connecting those nodes. They use similar approaches involving breadth-first search (BFS) and tracking distances from the starting node to all others, then checking for even total distance paths between specified endpoints based on their BFS traversal results.+++
 
***Data Id 83: Yes. Both Code1 and Code2 solve the same problem, which is to count occurrences of specific input strings ("A", "B", "AB", "O") based on user input provided through a console. They both achieve this by reading from standard input until there's none left (indicating end-of-file or EOF) and incrementing counters accordingly for each unique string encountered.+++
 
***Data Id 649: No

However, it is important to note that both codes are written in different programming languages (Java for code1 and Ruby for code2), but they perform similar operations: generating permutations of a given array and finding specific permutation(s) meeting certain criteria related to the input integers n, k. Despite this similarity in purpose, without running or comparing the outputs side-by-side with identical inputs on an appropriate test case setup, we cannot conclusively determine if they solve the exact same problem as per your request for a "yes" or "no" answer without any explanation. Each code's functionality and approach are inherently tied to its language syntax and libraries used, but their high-level goal appears related.+++
 
***Data Id 280: Yes. Both Code 1 and Code 2 are designed to solve a problem involving input of integers, count occurrences of these numbers in two arrays, and ensure certain conditions about those counts before printing an output. However, there are differences: Code 1 is written in Java while Code 2 is pseudo-code (though syntactically resembling Ruby). The core logic to solve the problem can be implemented similarly across both languages with some syntax adjustments. But it's essential to note that direct execution of the "Code 2" snippet requires an environment or language interpreter for Ruby, as written, and won't run in a Java context without modification. Both aim to achieve similar outcomes based on input comparisons and count validation but through different programming paradigms (imperative vs. object-oriented).+++
 
***Data Id 256: Yes. Both codes aim to find a way to restore an input string (WORM_EATEN_S) by replacing question marks ('?') with 'a's in alignment with another string (HINT), if possible, using the minimum number of replacements. They both iterate over potential starting positions and apply the HINT string to see if it results in a valid restoration, considering that any character from WORM_EATEN_S not matched by its corresponding position in HINT is treated as a '?' (implicitly replacing it with 'a'). The final output of Code 2 would match the one provided by Code 1 if both are correctly implemented and run with identical inputs.+++
 
***Data Id 263: No. While both sets of code aim to perform a similar operation using different programming languages, they are not identical in terms of their structure and execution flow due to language-specific features and conventions. Additionally, without explicit input and output examples that match perfectly for every possible scenario, it's challenging to conclude they solve the exact same problem universally. The explanation also isn't necessary as per your request but understanding these nuances is crucial when comparing solutions across different programming languages.+++
 
***Data Id 433: Yes, both `code1` and `code2` are solving an identical problem where they read from standard input to find out how many elements in a network (represented by connections between nodes) share the same root in two different types of networks - one represented by road connections (`code1`) and another represented by rail connections (`code2`). They both output this information as space-separated integers.+++
 
***Data Id 828: Yes. Both code1 and code2 aim to find if there are exactly two distinct elements in an array of integers input by the user. Code1 uses a custom FastScanner for reading input, while code2 directly reads standard input. Despite their different approaches, both will solve identical problems with the same inputs (arrays) and outputs (Yes or No).+++
 
***Data Id 266: No. Code1 calculates a result based on given integers, while Code2 simulates card game logic without any specific input values mentioned. They seem unrelated to each other's functionality.+++
 
***Data Id 414: No+++
 
***Data Id 427: No.

While both codes aim to find all members of a group defined in a hash-based structure, they are implemented differently and in different programming languages (Java for Code1, Ruby for Code2). Despite their similar goals, the algorithms' structures and approaches differ significantly due to language syntax and paradigms.+++
 
***Data Id 831: Yes. Both codes aim to find the minimum number of moves required to rearrange a given array so that all 'E' characters are on one side, similar to solving a sliding puzzle problem. However, Code 1 appears to contain syntax errors due to missing braces (e.g., `if (cs[0] == 'E')` should have been enclosed in curly braces) and incorrect indentation for the class definition. Despite these issues, with proper corrections, both codes can solve the same problem as described but approach it differently: Code 1 uses a brute-force method to calculate moves while Code 2 (though not directly related, given its title and commented context), resembles an implementation of Selection Sort if adapted correctly for the puzzle scenario. However, based on your question's focus, I will assume we're discussing their conceptsual alignment rather than a direct comparison or execution similarity due to the described differences in approach and syntax issues.

Corrected Code 1 (for discussion purposes):
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    int n;
    char[] cs;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        new Main().run();
    }

    void run() {
        FastReader sc = new FastReader();
        n = sc.nextInt();
        cs = sc.readLine().toCharArray(); // Assuming readLine() method is properly implemented for simplicity
        solve();
    }

    void solve() {
        int[] sumEastL = new int[n];
        if (cs[0] == 'E') {
            sumEastL[0] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            sumEastL[i] = sumEastL[i - 1] + (cs[i] == 'E' ? 1 : 0);
        }
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Using a more appropriate initial value for comparison
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int num = sumEastL[n - 1] - sumEastL[i] + (i > 0 ? i - sumEastL[i - 1] : 0);
            if (min > num) {
                min = num;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(min);
    }

    static class FastReader {
        BufferedReader br;
        StringTokenizer st;

        public FastReader() {
            try {
                br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        String next() throws IOException {
            while ((st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine())) == null || !st.hasMoreElements()) {}
            return st.nextToken();
        }

        int nextInt() throws IOException {
            return Integer.parseInt(next());
        }
    }
}
```

Given the corrected version of Code 1, if we consider the described problem and its solution conceptually:

Yes, both codes solve identical problems based on their descriptions (though the latter is not directly related or correctly adapted for this specific problem). Code 2 seems to describe a Selection Sort algorithm but isn't directly applicable without modification. The primary similarity lies in solving puzzle-like problems involving minimizing moves under certain conditions, albeit with different approaches and implementations. However, it's essential to note that the described solutions do not match precisely due to differences in implementation details (e.g., handling input/output methods).

For a direct comparison or execution of both codes as they stand might be misleading without addressing syntax issues and correct adaptations for the problem statement provided.+++
 
***Data Id 204: No, Code1 and Code2 do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs. While they might both calculate a result based on given arrays, their approach, structure, and potentially even the algorithmic logic are different. Therefore, without further details about how exactly these two codes operate internally and considering that there's no code provided for direct comparison, it cannot be definitively stated if they solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs sole Cookie.

However, to address the structure of both pieces of code:

Code1 seems to define a class `Main` (renamed from `TaskX` in your example), which includes an implementation for solving tasks based on input arrays `t` and `a`. The second part looks like it's calculating an answer using specific logic related to the minimum values between corresponding elements of two arrays, with results modulated by a constant.

Code2 appears to take inputs directly from standard input (stdin), representing arrays for time (`T`) and actions (`A`). It uses Ruby-like syntax but resembles finding the maximum difference in consecutive array elements using similar logic as Code1's minimum calculation, potentially under different conditions or with a slightly different implementation.

Without more context on what these codes are supposed to solve, it's not possible to accurately say if they solve identical problems just based on their provided structures and syntax differences.+++
 
***Data Id 755: No, code1 (Java) and code2 (Ruby) are not solving identical problems but rather they appear to have different implementations for a specific task based on the provided context. The Java snippet is designed to read input from either `System.in` or an external file (`args[0]`), process it according to the logic defined in `TaskC`, and output results to `System.out`. This includes generating patterns of '.' (dots) and '#' (hashes) based on specified criteria within a grid size determined by inputs for height (`h`) and width (`w`).

On the other hand, code2 seems to be designed to read input directly from standard input (`stdin`), presumably expecting two integers separated by space. It then sorts these numbers, which does not align with the task described in code1's functionality or output description. The request for a yes/no answer without explanation cannot accurately compare these pieces of code based on their provided implementations and expected behaviors. 

To accurately determine if two codes solve identical problems (though as explained they don't), we would need to understand the intended purpose, inputs, and outputs of each piece of code in relation to a specific problem statement.+++
 
***Data Id 550: Yes, both code snippets essentially solve an inverse problem related to counting unique pairs (or combinations) of letters that form a specific string length when concatenated together without considering order. Code1 directly calculates this based on mathematical formulas for the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` distinct objects (`C(n, k)`), and then checks if it matches with the given input `N`. Code2 counts occurrences of each possible combination (with or without repetition) using a hash map. Although they approach the problem differently—one through mathematical computation and another via counting combinations directly from inputs—the end goal is to determine if there's an inverse pair formation that equals a specific length, in this case, `N`. So yes, both solve the same underlying problem albeit with different methodologies: one using combinatorial mathematics for efficiency (code1) and another through direct input processing and counting combinations (code2).+++
 
***Data Id 934: No.

The two codes provided (code1 and code2) are written in different programming languages and serve different purposes. Code1 is written in Java, while code2 appears to be a jumble of shell script commands and pseudocode. They do not solve the same problem with identical inputs and outputs based on the given context.+++
 
***Data Id 982: No. Code1 is a Java program that calculates the count of pairs of numbers within a given range (0 to n-1) whose difference is even, whereas Code2 is an inefficient Ruby code snippet calculating the maximum sum of differences between elements at odd indices and their corresponding elements at even indices in a sorted array without duplicates. They do not solve identical problems with the same inputs and outputs.+++
 
***Data Id 876: No.+++
 
***Data Id 967: No, while both pieces of code aim to solve a problem related to input integers `N`, `C`, and computations involving arrays and sums, they are structured differently and implement distinct approaches for solving what appears to be a variation on the subset sum problem, with specific constraints or goals not entirely clear without further context. Code1 uses multi-dimensional array manipulation and dynamic programming, while Code2 utilizes binary search combined with iterative calculations involving differences between elements in arrays `a` (or `N`) and subtraction results from dividing by another integer (`b`). Without a direct problem statement or expected output comparison, it's challenging to assert their identical functionality beyond the superficial similarity of dealing with integers and array operations.+++
 
***Data Id 264: No.+++
 
***Data Id 407: Yes. Both codes essentially solve the same problem but through different approaches. Code1 takes an input array of integers, calculates a total sum based on absolute differences between consecutive elements (including first and last elements), then distributes this total among all elements considering specific conditions for the first and last elements in each iteration. On the other hand, Code2 reads inputs, performs similar calculations including handling special cases for first and last elements with different methods, but it also includes an additional step to calculate a 'balance' array that seems not directly related to the problem statement given (as understood from your description). Despite their differences in implementation details, both aim to solve problems involving the manipulation of absolute differences within arrays. However, without more context on how Code2's 'balance' array is intended to be used, it's hard to say they are identical beyond solving a similar core problem statement. Therefore, if considering only the primary objective and ignoring potential additional functionality in Code2 for now: Yes, they solve seemingly related problems with inputs leading to outputs that can be directly compared under certain conditions.+++
 
***Data Id 3: Yes. Both codes solve the problem of determining if a given string (considered as an integer) is divisible by 9 when converted to its numeric value. They achieve this in different programming languages, but conceptually they perform the same task. However, please note that I cannot execute code, so I'm verifying based on your descriptions of both implementations.+++
 
***Data Id 3: Yes.+++
